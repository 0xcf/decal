## Welcome to the Hands-On UNIX SysAdmin DeCal, Fall 2017 edition!
This course will cover the basics of setting up and administering a production-quality Linux-based server environment in the manner of the EECS instructional machines (hivexx.cs.berkeley.edu) and those of the Open Computing Facility (tsunami.ocf.b.e). By the end of this course, we expect you to be completely comfortable with:

* interfacing with Linux
* be broadly familiar with various fundamental things like services and daemons
* understand basic networking
* have a good sense about
* maintaining system security
* understand system administration essentials
* get a practical taste for what's new in the field

Lectures are scheduled for **8-9pm Tuesdays and Thursdays** in the OCF Lab, located at **171 MLK** (MLK basement down the hall from the student store). **Attendance is mandatory with two allowed unexcused abscences** (other conflicts such as exams can be excused).

The primary assignment in this course will be **weekly lab work**. In keeping with the name of the course, labs will be significantly hands-on. You will be **working on real systems**, configuring and fixing things. **Lecture will double as office hours** for students to come in and ask questions about the lab work. This is a **2 unit DeCal**.

An important skill for system administrators is the **willingness to learn quickly** about new and unfamiliar technologies, so while we expect many students will have a CS background, **the only real prerequisite is a desire to learn**. We assume **no prior experience** and will get started and move quickly - there's a lot of material to cover. Another important skill to learn is patience and perseverence. Don't be discouraged if things don't work: the internet is held together with the programmatic equivalent of duct tape, and the job of a sysadmin is best described as applying new duct tape when the old stuff wears out, which happens a lot.
