## Welcome to the Linux System Administration DeCal, Fall 2018 Edition!
This course will cover the basics of setting up and administering a
production-quality Linux-based server environment in the manner of the EECS
instructional machines (hivexx.cs.berkeley.edu) and those of the Open Computing
Facility (tsunami.ocf.b.e). By the end of this course, we expect you to:

* be comfortable using GNU/Linux
* understand how different parts of the OS work together,
  e.g. init, processes, daemons, filesystems, etc.
* understand basic networking on Linux
* have a good sense about maintaining system security
* understand system administration essentials
* get a practical taste of what sysadmins do in industry.

The course will be taught in two sections: one for students with minimal
prior background in GNU/Linux or system administration, and one for
students with more background/experience in the same. The sections are
titled Basic and Advanced, respectively.

An important skill for system administrators is the **willingness to learn
quickly** about new and unfamiliar technologies, so while we expect many
students will have a CS background, **the only real prerequisite is a desire
to learn**. The Basic section has been designed to introduce new users to Linux,
and the Advanced section has been designed to give more experienced users a
taste of what Linux is capable of. 

Another important skill to learn is patience and perseverence.
Don't be discouraged if things don't work with the first time: the internet
is held together with the programmatic equivalent of duct tape, and the job
of a sysadmin is best described as applying new duct tape when the old stuff
wears out, which happens a lot.


### Administrivia

Lectures are scheduled for **Tuesdays** for the Basic section and **Thursdays**
for the Advanced section, from from **8 to 9pm** the OCF Lab, located at
**171 MLK** (MLK basement down the hall from the student store).
**Attendance is mandatory, with two allowed unexcused absences.** Some other
conflicts, such as exams, may be excused with prior notice. Please only come
to the lab on the day corresponding to the section you are in in order to save
seats for students enrolled in the section being taught on that day. 

The primary assignment in this course will be **weekly lab work**.
Labs are designed to be be significantly hands-on. You will be **working on
real systems**, configuring, and fixing things, setting up services, and so on.

**Lecture will double as office hours** for students to come in and ask
questions about the lab work. This is a **2 unit DeCal**.
