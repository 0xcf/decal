# Advanced section, Lab 1
## Grading note
Labs are graded on completion. Treat this lab as seeds of exploration instead of just a grade. If you don't pass on the first submission, you can have it checked off in-person by a decal facilitator.

## Composability & workflows
This lab can be done on your own UNIX-like machine, or you can ssh into `tsunami.ocf.berkeley.edu` using your OCF account to finish the lab there. As always, `man` and Google will be your friends.

### Shell. web fetching, parsing, and frequency analysis.
Download Alice in Wonderland by parsing out a download link from Project Gutenberg.
    https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11

Isolate the body content from the headers and footers, perhaps saving to an intermediate file. 
Hint: `less` may be useful for inspection, and `sed` with no-echo option, and the #,#p class argument (play with ranges, offset, and start/end of file chars...twist on regex line terminators).

Process the document to get word counts. You may need to clean up the data, especially punctuation. As with all text processing in the shell, Regex will be your friend (and worst enemy). Check out [regexr](https://regexr.com/) to help you construct proper regular expressions.

`grep` has options to match whole words, and to print only match-contents (instead of a whole line containing a match). `sed` may also be useful for filtering by whitelisting and/or blacklisting characters. In either case, character classes "[_]" and (defining them negatively) "[^_]" can help. In both cases, use, but beware the `-` dash character: it gets interpreted as a range and triggers cryptic errors when that range is invalid. `tr`, `cut`, `sort`, and `uniq` also may be
useful.

What are the top 10 words, and their frequency? (for the google form)

Now that you know how to extract frequency distributions, create one per line. 


## niche tools & little support
Fixing a make file.

These tools are available in a [packaged form][brew], but for this lab we're having you compile them manually.


compile some obscure text-compose too with no apt or brew formula.

### textql or q
These tools allow you to query csv documents with SQL. 

extract, query

something fun or interesting to you (optional)

### jq. jshawn
These tools allow you to parse, restructure, and create JSON documents on the command line. 

extract...by key

make json list

... something interesting (optional)


[brew]:  `brew` package manager has usefully good support on macOS (its original target) and on linux.
