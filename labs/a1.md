# Advanced section, Lab 1

## Grading note
Labs are graded on completion. Treat this lab as seeds of exploration instead 
of just a grade. If you don't pass on the first submission, you can have it 
checked off in-person by a decal facilitator.

Since you know how to use unix tools (though you may be more or less familiar 
with certain tools), the goal of this lab is to drop you in the wilderness. You 
can find your way out! :D


## Composability & workflows
This lab can be done on your own UNIX-like machine, or you can ssh into 
`tsunami.ocf.berkeley.edu` using your OCF account to finish the lab there. As 
always, `man` and Google will be your friends.


### Shell. web fetching, parsing, and frequency analysis.
- [ ] Download Alice in Wonderland by parsing out a download link from Project 
Gutenberg.

    https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11

As it turns out, Project Gutenberg doesn't like users of `curl`, and will 
demand you enable javascript.  It's probably a resonable defense against
naive abuse of `curl` by people scraping the site, but it's annoying to deal 
with.

You can just tell the server that you're Firefox instead:

```
curl -s -A "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Ubuntu Chromium/51.0.2704.79 Chrome/51.0.2704.79 Safari/537.36" https://www.gutenberg.org/
```

- [ ] Isolate the body content from the headers and footers, perhaps saving to 
an intermediate file. 

Hints: 
* `less` may be useful for inspection, and `sed` with no-echo option. 

* `sed`'s "#,#p" line-number/print argument (play with ranges, offset, and 
start/end of file chars...twist on regex line terminators).

- [ ] Process the document to get word counts. You may need to clean up the 
data, especially punctuation. 

Hints:

* As with all text processing in the shell, regex 
will be your friend (and worst enemy). Check out [regexr](https://regexr.com/) 
to help you construct proper regular expressions.

* `grep` has options to match whole words, and to print only match-contents 
(instead of a whole line containing a match). You need not use 
"regex-grouping", just a pattern. 

* `sed` may also be useful for filtering by whitelisting and/or blacklisting 
characters. In either case, character classes `[_]` and (defining them 
negatively) `[^_]` can help. In both cases, use, but beware the `-` dash 
character: it gets interpreted as a range and triggers cryptic errors when that 
range is invalid. `tr`, `cut`, `sort`, and `uniq` also may be
useful.

### Questions (answer on Google form)
1. What are the top 10 words, and their frequency?

## niche tools & little support

### jq. jshawn.
These tools allow you to parse, restructure, and create 
[JSON](https://www.json.org/) documents on the 
command line. Today, we're using `jq`. It should be installed already on `tsunami`

- [ ] Get location, lat long from a json api.

```
 curl 'http://api.geonames.org/postalCodeSearchJSON?postalcode=12345&maxRows=10&username=ocf_decal' -o location.json
```
- [ ] Parse out values with `jq`
Some command snippets that may help you with `jq`:

```
cat location.json  \
        | jq '.postalCodes[] | select(.placeName=="Berkeley") | {"lat": .lat, 
"long": .lng}'

    location.json -> { key: [ {...}, {...}] }
    jq '.key'   -> [1,2]
    jq '.key[]' -> 1,2

    jq '.[] | select(.key == "value")'

    jq '. | { "k1": .key1, "k2": .key2 }'
```

- [ ] Get ISS flyovers by location.
Docs:
    http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/ISS-Pass-Times/ 

Consider using the pipemill pattern with `date`. It can take an argument for 
time to display, but it requires some syntax mangling you can find in the man 
pages.

### Questions
1. When is the next flyovers of Berkeley? Berlin?

\(Look up at the sky.\)


#### Other APIs
SpaceX has a [beautiful API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API) presenting 
information about at least launches.
