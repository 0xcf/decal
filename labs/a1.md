# Advanced section, Lab 1
## Grading note
Labs are graded on completion. Treat this lab as seeds of exploration instead of just a grade. If you don't pass on the first submission, you can have it checked off in-person by a decal facilitator.

Since you know how to use unix tools (though you may be more or less familiar with certain tools), the goal of this lab is to drop you in the wilderness. You can find your way out.


## Composability & workflows
This lab can be done on your own UNIX-like machine, or you can ssh into `tsunami.ocf.berkeley.edu` using your OCF account to finish the lab there. As always, `man` and Google will be your friends.


### Shell. web fetching, parsing, and frequency analysis.
Download Alice in Wonderland by parsing out a download link from Project Gutenberg.

    https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11

As it turns out, Project Gutenberg doesn't like users of curl, and will demand you enable javascript.  It's probably a resonable defense against naive abuse of curl by people scraping the site, but it's annoying to deal with.


You can just tell the server that you're Firefox instead:

    curl -s -A "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Ubuntu Chromium/51.0.2704.79 Chrome/51.0.2704.79 Safari/537.36"  https://www.gutenberg.org/

Isolate the body content from the headers and footers, perhaps saving to an intermediate file. 

Hint: 
`less` may be useful for inspection, and`sed` with no-echo option. 

`sed`'s "#,#p" line-number/print argument (play with ranges, offset, and start/end of file chars...twist on regex line terminators).

Process the document to get word counts. You may need to clean up the data, especially punctuation. As with all text processing in the shell, Regex will be your friend (and worst enemy). Check out [regexr](https://regexr.com/) to help you construct proper regular expressions.

(regex)

`grep` has options to match whole words, and to print only match-contents (instead of a whole line containing a match). You need not use "regex-grouping", just a pattern. 

`sed` may also be useful for filtering by whitelisting and/or blacklisting characters. In either case, character classes "[_]" and (defining them negatively) "[^_]" can help. In both cases, use, but beware the `-` dash character: it gets interpreted as a range and triggers cryptic errors when that range is invalid. `tr`, `cut`, `sort`, and `uniq` also may be
useful.

What are the top 10 words, and their frequency? (for the google form)


Now that you know how to extract frequency distributions, create one per line.  (Recall techniques mentioned in lecture).


## niche tools & little support
Fixing a make file. You'll get away without doing this today, but oftentimes, other people's minimally packaged code can be a good resource.

These tools are available in a [packaged form][brew], but for this lab we're having you fetch them manually.

\(compile some obscure text-compose too with no apt or brew formula.\)


### jq. jshawn.
These tools allow you to parse, restructure, and create JSON documents on the command line. Today, we're using `jq`. Find and download the utility.

- [ ] Get location, lat long from a json api.
    curl 'http://api.geonames.org/postalCodeSearchJSON?postalcode=12345&maxRows=10&username=ocf_decal' -o location.json

- [ ] Parse out values with jq
    cat location.json  \
        | jq '.postalCodes[] | select(.placeName=="Berkeley") | {"lat": .lat, "long": .lng}'

    location.json -> { key: [ {...}, {...}] }
    jq '.key'   -> [1,2]
    jq '.key[]' -> 1,2

    jq '.[] | select(.key == "value")'

    jq '. | { "k1": .key1, "k2": .key2 }'

- [ ] Get ISS flyovers by location.
Docs:
    http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/ISS-Pass-Times/ 

Consider using the pipemill pattern with `date`. It can take an argument for time to display, but it requires some syntax mangling you can find in the man pages.

When is the next flyovers of Berkeley? Berlin?

\(Look up at the sky.\)


#### Other APIs
SpaceX has a [beautiful API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API) presenting information about at least launches.
Something you found fun or interesting (optional)

    https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis
    https://github.com/jdorfman/awesome-json-datasets
    https://www.data.gov/


### textql. or q.
These tools allow you to query csv documents with SQL. 

Let's use q. Download it from

    http://harelba.github.io/q/

Remember, you can run it locally as `./q` without modifying your path.

    ps -ef | q -H "SELECT UID, COUNT(*) cnt FROM - GROUP BY UID ORDER BY cnt DESC LIMIT 3"

Record the results of ^^  

Find the 3 most prolific parent processes on the system (look at `ps -ef output`)...and construct a similar query.
    What query?
    What results?

Find the process which spawned the most of *your* processes.
    What query?
    What results?

## Feedback
What were the...most (unnecessarily) painful part(s)...of this lab? 


What were the...best parts...of this lab? 


What's something that surprised or intriqued you as you completed the lab?


[brew]:  `brew` package manager has usefully good support on macOS (its original target) and on linux.
