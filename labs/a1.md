### Grading note
Labs are graded on completion. Treat this lab as seeds of exploration instead 
of just a grade. If you don't pass on the first submission, you can have it 
checked off in-person by a decal facilitator. As this is the first lab, it
is intentionally simple and easy to complete, but should introduce you to some
fun bash features you may not have encountered before, such as loops and shell
expansions.

### Workflow
This lab can be done on your own UNIX-like machine, or you can ssh into 
`tsunami.ocf.berkeley.edu` using your OCF account to finish the lab there. As 
always, `man` and Google will be your friends.

## Question 1

Using Bash functions, write a script that generates a user-specified number of files of
user-specified size filled with random content.

e.g.

```bash
$ ./mkrandom 10 100  # create 10 100 byte random files
$ ls -lAh
total 44K
-rw-r--r-- 1 abizer ocf  100 Sep 16 21:57 1
-rw-r--r-- 1 abizer ocf  100 Sep 16 21:57 10
-rw-r--r-- 1 abizer ocf  100 Sep 16 21:57 2
-rw-r--r-- 1 abizer ocf  100 Sep 16 21:57 3
-rw-r--r-- 1 abizer ocf  100 Sep 16 21:57 4
-rw-r--r-- 1 abizer ocf  100 Sep 16 21:57 5
-rw-r--r-- 1 abizer ocf  100 Sep 16 21:57 6
-rw-r--r-- 1 abizer ocf  100 Sep 16 21:57 7
-rw-r--r-- 1 abizer ocf  100 Sep 16 21:57 8
-rw-r--r-- 1 abizer ocf  100 Sep 16 21:57 9
-rwxr-xr-x 1 abizer ocf  147 Sep 16 21:56 mkrandom
```

You may want to look into `dd` and the `iflag=fullblock` argument,
`seq`, and `/dev/random`.

## Question 2

Using Bash functions and shell wildcard expansion, write a
shell script to batch rename file extensions in a particular directory.

e.g.

```bash
$ mkdir tmp && touch tmp/{a..z}.dat
$ ./rename tmp dat txt
renaming tmp/a.dat to tmp/a.txt
...
renaming tmp/z.dat to tmp/z.txt
$ ls -lAh tmp | grep .txt | wc -l
26
```

for bonus points, instead of using something like `sed` to affect the rename,
use [shell parameter expansion][1].

## Question 3

I like Lisp and Scheme, and miss `car` and `cdr` in my usual programming tasks.

In bash, implement `car` and `cdr` (aka `head` and `tail`) such that they
operate on file paths.

e.g.

```bash
$ ./car /home/a/ab/abizer/some/path
home
$ ./cdr /home/a/ab/abizer/some/path
a/ab/abizer/some/path
```

There's no need to use complicated string manipulation for this task.
You may assume that only absolute paths will be given.

bonus points: generalize this solution to work for `cadr`, `caddr`, etc.

```bash
$ ./cadr /home/a/ab/abizer/some/path
a
$ ./cddr /home/a/ab/abizer/some/path
ab/abizer/some/path
```
