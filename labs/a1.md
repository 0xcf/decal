### A Note on Labs
Labs are graded on completion. Treat this lab as seeds of exploration instead 
of just a grade. 

As this is the first lab, it is intentionally simple and easy to complete.  Bash scripting
isn't a particular goal of the DeCal but this lab should introduce you to some fun bash
features you may not have encountered before, such as loops and shell expansions. 

### Workflow
This lab can be done on your own UNIX-like machine, or you can ssh into
`tsunami.ocf.berkeley.edu` using your OCF account to finish the lab there. As always,
`man` and Google will be your friends.

## Question 1

Using Bash functions, write a script `mkrandom.sh` that generates a user-specified number
of files of user-specified size filled with random content.

e.g.

```bash
$ ./mkrandom.sh 10 100  # create 10 100 byte random files
$ ls -lAh
total 44K
-rw-r--r-- 1 abizer ocf  100 Sep 16 21:57 1
-rw-r--r-- 1 abizer ocf  100 Sep 16 21:57 10
-rw-r--r-- 1 abizer ocf  100 Sep 16 21:57 2
-rw-r--r-- 1 abizer ocf  100 Sep 16 21:57 3
-rw-r--r-- 1 abizer ocf  100 Sep 16 21:57 4
-rw-r--r-- 1 abizer ocf  100 Sep 16 21:57 5
-rw-r--r-- 1 abizer ocf  100 Sep 16 21:57 6
-rw-r--r-- 1 abizer ocf  100 Sep 16 21:57 7
-rw-r--r-- 1 abizer ocf  100 Sep 16 21:57 8
-rw-r--r-- 1 abizer ocf  100 Sep 16 21:57 9
-rwxr-xr-x 1 abizer ocf  147 Sep 16 21:56 mkrandom
```

You may want to look into `dd`[^dd] and the `iflag=fullblock` argument,
`seq`, and `/dev/random`[^rand].

[^dd]: `dd` is a command used to copy files.[^dd2]

[^dd2]: "But wait," a nearby straw-man asks, "isn't that what `cp` does?"[^dd3]

[^dd3]: They are indeed right, but `dd` has some useful features such as partial writing
    and reading that make it handy in weirder scenarios, such as devices.  StackOverflow has
    a [good explainer][so] and the ArchWiki has some [common examples][aw].

[so]: https://superuser.com/questions/609211/why-do-we-use-cp-to-copy-files-and-not-dd-in-unix-derivatives

[aw]: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dd

[^rand]: A curious individual might find the device file `/dev/urandom` as well. What's
    the difference? True randomness is a rather difficult problem for computers, as they're
    expected to do the same thing given the same state, so they pull in random data from
    metrics like internal temperature and mouse movement. Unfortunately, such entropy may
    not exist in certain machines and gathering entropy may be prohibitively long. Thus,
    `/dev/urandom`, or "unlimited random", is a useful source when such randomness is not
    cryptographically critical. 


## Question 2

Using Bash functions and shell wildcard expansion, write a
shell script `rename.sh` to batch rename file extensions in a particular directory.

e.g.

```bash
$ mkdir tmp && touch tmp/{a..z}.dat
$ ./rename.sh tmp dat txt
renaming tmp/a.dat to tmp/a.txt
...
renaming tmp/z.dat to tmp/z.txt
$ ls -lAh tmp | grep .txt | wc -l
26
```

for bonus points, instead of using something like `sed` to affect the rename,
use [shell parameter expansion][1].

## Question 3

I like Lisp and Scheme, and miss `car` and `cdr` in my usual programming tasks.

In bash, implement `car` and `cdr` (aka `head` and `tail`) such that they
operate on file paths.

e.g.

```bash
$ ./car /home/a/ab/abizer/some/path
home
$ ./cdr /home/a/ab/abizer/some/path
a/ab/abizer/some/path
```

There's no need to use complicated string manipulation for this task.
You may assume that only absolute paths will be given. 

bonus points: generalize this solution to work for `cadr`, `caddr`, etc.

```bash
$ ./cadr /home/a/ab/abizer/some/path
a
$ ./cddr /home/a/ab/abizer/some/path
ab/abizer/some/path
```

Hint: The easiest way to do this is with one very short command.

## Question 4

At some point, everyone has looked at a problem and thought to themselves:
"Hey, I can do this in one line!"

Lets find out if you can. I need to sort out some of my most listened to albums
by making directories for each of their songs, specifically for my favorite artist Future.

You need to fetch the list of albums and their respective artist from
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xcf/decal-labs/master/a1/albums.txt`.
Filter out the albums we want, trim out the album name,
and then make a directory for each one, all in one line.

```
$ cat albums.txt
...
Drip or Drown 2, Gunna
Playboi Carti, Playboi Carti
DS2 (Deluxe), Future
Drip Harder, Lil Baby
...

# After our magic one liner!

$ ls
'DS2 (Deluxe)'   ...
```

Hint: Use `man` to see what arguments you need to xargs to behave the way you want.
If you're tired of repeatedly testing commands, try using an online `sed` REPL to iterate faster.
