## Overview

In this lab, we'll be setting up [Gitolite](http://gitolite.com/gitolite/index.html), an open-source Git server. In addition, we'll also be
working with rsync, a command-line program to sync files and folders between different machines.

## Gitolite

### Generating an SSH key

Gitolite identifies its users through their SSH public key. Since you'll need to interact with Gitolite from your OCF account on tsunami, in
order to complete the lab, you'll first have to generate an SSH keypair on tsunami.

On `tsunami.ocf.berkeley.edu`, create a directory called `.ssh` in your home directory. Within `.ssh`, run `ssh-keygen` and hit enter until
it finishes generating a public-private keypair. When you install Gitolite on your DigitalOcean VM, you'll need to input the contents of
**id_rsa.pub**, so leave the terminal session open.

### Installing Gitolite

Log into your **DigitalOcean VMs** and install Gitolite using apt. The package name in the apt system is `gitolite3`.
When you are prompted for the administrator's SSH key, paste in the contents of **id_rsa.pub** (not `id_rsa`!) from tsunami.
If you mess up when configuring the admin SSH key or accidentally paste in the contents of `id_rsa`, you can run `sudo apt purge gitolite3`
to remove the package and all of its config files, and try installing it again.
