title: Lab 10 - Version Control and Backups
layout: lab

## Overview

In this lab, we'll be talking about using version control, in particular Git, for keeping track of changes to your files and backing up your files to other machines. 
We'll be setting up [Gitolite](http://gitolite.com/gitolite/index.html), an open-source Git server that allows you to host Git repositories on other machines,
and set access to Git repositories hosted on the Gitolite server.

## A Git Primer

Version control tools are designed to keep track of changes to files, and allow you to rewind to some last saved state. 
git, as one of the most popular version control tools in use today, supports these features, but also allows for more advanced workflows such as splitting a filebase into "branches" for experimentation.
In order to complete this lab, you'll need to know a few basic git commands and some terminology.

- A folder can be made into a git **repository** by running `git init`, telling git that files under the folder can start being tracked by git.
- A git repository can also be **cloned** from online by running `git clone [repository url]`, which will create a copy of the repository
on your machine.
- However, files do not have their changes tracked by git by default. In order to tell git to track changes made to a file, run `git add [file]`.
- git groups a set of changes into a **commit**. Tracked files in a git repository do not have their contents saved in git until `git commit` is run. You can think of `git commit` as creating a snapshot of all modifications made to all tracked files since the last commit.
- In order to back up changes in a repository to another machine, or download changes from another machine to your local machine, git allows you to set **remotes**. Adding a remote is done by running `git remote add [remote url]`.
- In order to back up changes on a local repository to a remote, run `git push [remote name]`. By convention, the primary remote set for a repository is called "origin". If you clone a repository, its origin is automatically set to the URL you cloned from.
- In order to download changes from a remote to a local repository, run `git pull [remote name]`.

## Gitolite

### Generating an SSH key

Gitolite identifies its users through their SSH public key. Since you'll need to interact with Gitolite from your OCF account on tsunami, in
order to complete the lab, you'll first have to generate an SSH keypair on tsunami.

On `tsunami.ocf.berkeley.edu`, create a directory called `.ssh` in your home directory. Within `.ssh`, run `ssh-keygen` and hit enter until
it finishes generating a public-private keypair. When you install Gitolite on your DigitalOcean VM, you'll need to input the contents of
**id_rsa.pub**, so leave the terminal session open.

### Installing Gitolite

Log into your **DigitalOcean VM** and install Gitolite using apt. The package name in the apt system is `gitolite3`.
When you are prompted for the administrator's SSH key, paste in the contents of **id_rsa.pub** (not `id_rsa`!) from `tsunami`.
If you mess up when configuring the admin SSH key or accidentally paste in the contents of `id_rsa`, you can run `sudo apt purge gitolite3`
to remove the package and all of its config files, and try installing it again.

After you've finished installing Gitolite, verify that it is running by running the command `ssh gitolite3@[your VM's address] info` from
`tsunami`. It should produce an output similar to:
```
hello admin, this is gitolite3@test running gitolite3 3.6.6-1 (Debian) on git 2.11.0

 R W	gitolite-admin
 R W	testing
```

### Configuring Gitolite

Gitolite configuration, unusually, is done by cloning the `gitolite-admin` git repository hosted on the Gitolite server, modifying it,
and sending the updated repository back by pushing.

In order to clone the configuration repository to tsunami, run `git clone gitolite3@[your VM's address]:gitolite-admin` from tsunami.
If all goes well, a folder called `gitolite-admin` will appear in your current directory.

#### Adding a New User

As the administrator of the Gitolite server, you automatically get an account on the Gitolite server(Gitolite accounts are entirely separate
from Linux user accounts). For the purposes of this lab's checkoff, we'll have you add a new user to the Gitolite server, which will be done
by adding a new file in the `keydir/` subdirectory that contains the SSH public key of the new Gitolite user.

Navigate to the directory `keydir` under the `gitolite-admin` folder. Create a new file named `decal-checkoff.pub` using the editor of your choice, and paste in this SSH public key:
```
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDY1qy6OE8M1gZWhyBsjE66ip+3mQpDWhP7LvT2uBloHqY6s/AkuB9Ao3hbLkJuKPghDII4UOH4DGzvcBypTjh5ClxHRMY3mInTJ6OSOuyF1lpw3SYkbIWlVWkyUABqUkt4pgWuiK6gz8egNtOo4XWf2254D+HGuYxHmLq+CInQcdqU9Wy8xmxMaq4RVqDnlmItHW6EZb4b09I87Z5T4mnc148d8p/cZ2oKXWC20EOyg55UVeTVTZw4ETzDXFFL1rOQPiMMjVfnXqoubsUCBjrctryQcxCLL3m3bOEHexAiRYmD5ItR4EiEBxiWaglBMu6OhcVYDHOQ2MEnGFbuhqXH test@test
```

After the key has been added, you'll need to add, commit, and push the file to the Gitolite server through Git.
Assuming you are in `keydir/`, run `git add decal-checkoff.pub` to track the file under Git, `git commit` with a message describing the changes made in the commit,
and finally `git push origin` to push the changes up to the Gitolite server.

#### Adding a new Git repository

Now that you've added a new Gitolite user, you'll need to create a new Git repository that they can access.
In Gitolite, this is done by modifying the `conf/gitolite.conf` file within the `gitolite-admin` repository.

Edit `gitolite.conf` to create a new repository with name `decal-checkoff` with `RW+` access given to both `admin` (you) and `decal-checkoff`.
Hopefully, you can figure out what format Gitolite expects by looking at the entires for the `admin` and `testing` repositories.
The only gotcha is that multiple users have to separated by a space and nothing else.

Once you have done that, follow the same Git workflow as with `decal-checkoff.pub` to add, commit, and push the changes to `gitolite.conf`
to the Gitolite server.

If you've done everything correctly, running `ssh gitolite3@[your VM's address] info` should display something like:
```
hello admin, this is gitolite3@test running gitolite3 3.6.6-1 (Debian) on git 2.11.0

 R W	decal-checkoff
 R W	gitolite-admin
 R W	testing
```

However, please make sure that you have added the `decal-checkoff` user and given it permissions for the `decal-checkoff` repository,
as we will be using the `ssh info` command to check you off for the lab, and the command only works if the `decal-checkoff` user has been
added properly.

## Backups

We'll be briefly practicing using `rsync`, a powerful file transfer tool often used in backup scenarios. It is difficult to 
overstate the degree to which `rsync` and the rsync delta-transfer algorithm are used in the real world.

On a superficial level, `rsync` works similarly to `scp` - it copies files from `src` to `dst`, optionally over the network,
through an SSH tunnel. What makes `rsync` in particular so powerful is its ability to keep two directories synchronized
while transferring little beyond the absolute difference in files between the two directories. It does this by calculating 
the differences between blocks in a file, and only transferring the difference (the 'delta').

The basic syntax of `rsync` is `rsync [options] [[user]@host:]source [[user]@host:]dest` - you can either transfer files
in the local filesystem, between the local system and a network host, or between network hosts. 

`rsync` has dozens of options, but the most common are the following:
  * `-r` `--recursive`: recursively transfer all files and subdirectories in the source
  * `-v` `--verbose`: verbosely print out file names and transfer speeds
  * `-P` `--partial --progress`: keep partially transferred files, show progress of file transfers
  * `-a` `--archive`: combination option, implies `-r`, and preservation of most file metadata properties
  * `-u` `--append`: append data to the end of files on the destination that are smaller than the corresponding
                     file on the source
  * `-z` `--compress`: compress files before transfer
                     
Suppose you keep all your homework in a directory "school", in your home directory:
```
user@machine [~/school] $ ls
cs198-8
cs61a
cs262
some_r1a
ds8
```
and you want to back everything to your student VM. A command like:

    $ rsync -arvzP ~/school user@user.decal.xcf.sh:school-backup/
    
would result in a copy of your `school` directory being made inside the `school-backup` directory on your student VM.

Play around with `rsync` yourself. We've provided some test files [here](https://decal.ocf.berkeley.edu/static/b10/b10.tar.gz).
After extracting the archive, (`tar xzvf b10.tar.gz`), you'll see two directories with over 100MB of files in them. What happens
if you try `rsync`ing `dir1` to `dir2`? (hint: it should finish almost instantaneously). Why might this be the case? What `rsync` 
commands would you use to keep both directories in sync, and the forward- and backwards- directions (e.g. source->dest and dest->source)? What happens if you truncate one of the files in the dest directory (e.g. `dir2`, by `truncate --size=5M file2.txt`)
and then try `rsync` again? 

## Conclusion

Now that you know how to set up a Gitolite server and add users and repositories to it, you can now use your VM as a git remote to back up
your programming projects, fanfic collections, etc., free from the prying eyes of our Github overlords.

## Checkoff
