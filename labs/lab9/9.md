## Overview

Weâ€™re going to set up a flask app. And we are going to call it basicapp

There is 3 main component to this lab. We will install Nginx, uWSGI, and flask through the apt command. Then we will git clone an example app and config files from class repository. Next, we will modify the configuration files. If configured correctly, we'll go through the startup procedure. Then end it with some debugging tips and tricks. 

## Note

* No sudo was included in any command examples. Use your best judgment to include sudo or not. 

### The Setup

We need virtualenv and git for staging. Run

    apt install virtualenv git

Next, we'll create the directory where our project will be located. We'll just call it [basicapp] and we'll place it in /opt/. 

    mkdir /opt/basicapp

Next, we'll set up our virturalenv. Virtualenv is a python tool that lets you create a custom python execution environment that is specific to your project. This is so dependencies or modified libraries does not pollute your main coding environment. Let's create the virtualenv for this project and activate it. 

    chown $USER:www-data basicapp
    cd /opt/basicapp
    virtualenv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    

You can see a (venv) in the beginning of your prompt. Now all your python code will execute the venv version of python. Located in "/opt/basicapp/venv/bin/python". And it'll add venv to top of your python path, that means your python library will search venv first before search global library directory. 

Let's git clone from my repository. It contains a very basic flask app and very standard config file for Nginx and uwsgi. 

    
    git clone https://github.com/0xcf/decal/
    mv decal/labs/lab9/* .
    

Inside the directory, there is a requirements.txt file. This is a list of my python libraries for my flask app. Let's install it.

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Notice, that hese packages are installed into your venv directory. They are only available when your virtual environment is activated. 


### Three little Servers

Let's test your basicapp.py. 

    python basicapp.py

In your browser, go to your server domain with port 5000. [username].decal.xcf.sh:5000 You should see "Hello from Flask!" on your browser. Leave the server running on terminal. Lets' do a quick self check using a fabric file. 

-----
* Self Check : basicapp

Run this command in your virtual environment
    fab check basicapp

-----

You can change ports on this development server by editing basicapp.py file. In the line "app.run()", try adding argument port=5001, or debug=True. Control-C to exit.

To get our uWSGI running, let's install it through apt.

    apt install uwsgi uwsgi-plugin-python

Next, we need to edit basicapp.ini, your uWSGI config file. Then we'll move it to a location accessible to the uwsgi server. 

Check uwsgi.py exist in your directory. This file contains your callable function app. This is called by uWSGI to reach your app. 

Open 'basicapp.ini' file. This is the config file for uWSGI. Look for 'wsgi-file' variable. This is set to your uwsgi.py file. The 'callable' variable should be set to 'app'. Equivalently, 'module = basicapp:app' should give you the same result. 

The 'chdir' variable should be set to your project directory. uWSGI startup file will change the working directory to this assigned location. Any other relative file path will be relative to this location. 

If you have project name different than 'basicapp', change every instance of 'basicapp' to your app name. 

'pythonpath' and 'virtualenv' helps uWSGI to find the right packages.

In Debian based systems, Apache2 and Nginx are assigned 'www-data' for their user and group. In our uwsgi config, we set 'gid' and 'uid' to 'www-data'. That way when systemd runs the startup script, it would know what user and group to set uWSGI process to.  

'master = true' respawns processes if the processes die. uWSGI starts a master processes that spawn application server processes, and it monitors these children processes in case of failure.

'processes' and 'threads' tells uWSGI master the number of processes to spawn and how many threads per process. It's arbitrary set at this point. It should increase as your application demand increase, up to your system resource limit. 

'socket' is where uWSGI and Nginx communicates. It can be Unix sockets or internet sockets. As long as nginx is set to the same location. Right now, 0.0.0.0:8370 is assigned. The IP 0.0.0.0 tells the uWSGI server to attach to no specific IP. That means it's accessible from anywhere in the network. It can be used to communicate reverse proxy located on a different physical server.

For testing purposes, lets comment out the 'socket' line. And add a line for http-socket. 

    http-socket = :8370

Save this file and we run uWSGI with this configuration. First, check if a uwsgi process is already running. If so kill it. Either by `systemctl stop uwsgi` or `kill -9` 

    uwsgi --ini basicapp.ini

You should be able to see your app running on port 8370. (ports I choose is arbitrary, Just as long as it's not occupied by another process or below 1024) 

If you do not see your flask app, it might be because we have not changed our project folder owner and groups yet. Change the folder group to 'www-data'. And chmod with a group read, write, and execute permission. Rerun uwsgi after the changes.

First kill uWSGI processes. I use `ps aux | grep uwsgi` to locate the process, and `kill -9 [pid]` to kill the process or use top/htop. You might notice only killing one of the processes is effective. That's the master process respawning the server back up. Kill the smallest PID process.

If you see your app running in the browser, change the config file back to socket. Comment out `http-socket` and add line `socket = 127.0.0.1:8370`. This binds the server localhost, so only services within the physical server itself can access this port. The [uwsgi_port] is 8370.

To make this file accessible to the uwsgi server at startup, let's put it in the default config location in "/etc/uwsgi/app-available/" and symbolic link it to "/etc/uwsgi/app-enabled/".

    
    mv /opt/basicapp/basicapp.ini /etc/uwsgi/app-available/
    ln -s /etc/uwsgi/app-available/basicapp.ini /etc/uwsgi/app-enabled/basicapp.ini
    
Let's also touch the log file just so we have it. 

    touch /opt/basicapp/basicapp.log

Start uWSGI server. This time we'll use systemctl to start the server. First, make sure all uwsgi process is killed. Then in command prompt type.

    systemctl start uwsgi

Check for uwsgi processes. Then check the logs.

    tail -n 15 /var/log/uwsgi/app/basicapp.log

Decipher if it's working or not.

* Self Check Station: uWSGI

Run this command in your virtual environment
    fab check uwsgi

#### Nginx

Nginx by default serves to port 80. To avoid conflicts, let's shut down other services running on port 80. First, install Nginx. Run the command if you're not sure.

    apt install nginx

We'll edit the config file from GitHub then move it to the right location. First, let's go over some of the configuration options for 'basicapp.conf'.

For the line "listen 80;", change it to an available [port]. 

    
    #for a public HTTP server:
    listen [port];
    
In line 6, 

    #server_name localhost ...;

Change it to your server domain. [username].decal.xcf.sh

On line 10,

    uwsgi_pass 127.0.0.1:[usgi_port]

Change the port to your uwsgi port from steps above. 

On line 24 and 27 with alias,

      23     location /static {
      24         alias /opt/basicapp/static;
      25     }
      26     location /favicon.ico {
      27         alias /opt/basicapp/static/favicon.ico;
      28     }
      
Change alias file directory to your app directory. 

Move the file to nginx's virtual host config folder and make a symbolic link, aka soft link.

    
    mv /opt/basicapp/basicapp.conf /etc/nginx/sites-available/
    ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/basicapp.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/basicapp.conf
    

Before we start nginx, lets check the default file in nginx's virtual host config folder and make sure it's not listening on port 80. `/etc/nginx/sites-available/basicapp.conf` Change the port if its on 80. 

Let's start nginx.

    systemctl start nginx

The systemd starts nginx on apt install. We never shut it down. Instead lets run
    
    systemctl restart nginx
    
If everything is running, Check your server on your browser with the port you set.

`fab check nginx`

Make a uwsgi.py file
Make a flaskr.ini file for uwsgi
Put it in apps-available
