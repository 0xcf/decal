title: Beginner Lab 1 - Unix, the Shell, OSS
layout: lab

Welcome to the first lab! Here are some commands you might find helpful:
`cat, cd, emacs, file, grep, less, ls, man, nano, tar, wget, vim`

Remember: Google and `man` are your friends!

## Shell spelunking
**Everything should be done via the shell!**

The purpose of this lab is to get you comfortable with using the shell for
things you might typically use a GUI for. While these tasks may seem simplistic
or limited, you'll quickly find that the commands have many different options
(flags) to perform tasks that are either impossible or incredibly tedious /
difficult to complete using traditional methods.

0. `ssh` into `tsunami.ocf.berkeley.edu` using your OCF account, or login at
   [ssh.ocf.berkeley.edu](https://ssh.ocf.berkeley.edu)

1. Run the following command to download the file we have provided:
   `wget https://decal.ocf.berkeley.edu/static/b1/b01.tgz`

   A `.tgz` file is actually a composition of two file formats. Sometimes
   you'll see these files as `.tar.gz` instead. A common (and old) way of
   archiving is with magnetic tapes. However, in order to archive the data, it
   needs to be a single file, and often you want to archive multiple files at
   once. This is where the `tar` command comes in (`tar` stands for tape
   archive). Tar will group (or ungroup) multiple files into a single one.

   `tar`, unless you ask it to, doesn't compress files itself though. This is
   where either `gzip` (or `bzip2`) comes in. `gzip` will compress your file,
   and so, tar + gzip is often used in conjunction. It looks something like
   this: `file --(tar)--> file.tar --(gzip)--> fill.tar.gz`.

   If you read the `tar` documentation carefully enough, you'll see that you
   can give the command an option to compress your files using `gzip` as well,
   saving you a total of one line of shell command!

   To unarchive the file we provide you, run the following command:
   `tar xvzf b01.tgz`. This will provide a `b01` directory for you with some
   files for the rest of this lab.

   `tar` has a reputation for being a bit tricky with its options:
   ![XKCD 1168](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/tar.png)

2. Go into the `b01` directory. Make sure you're in there by running `cwd`
   (Current working directory). What does `cwd` give you?

3. There's a hidden file in the `b01` directory. What is the secret?

4. A malicious user made its way into my computer and added a bunch of nonsense
   files. What do the files say? (Hint: They all have the same contents). Help
   me get rid of them by deleting all of these files and the directory they are
   in.

5. There's a file in `b01` called `big_data.txt`. It's 80 megabytes worth of
   random text. For reference, Leo Tolstoy's "War and Peace", the novel with a
   whopping 57,287 words depicting the French invasion of Russia and the impact
   of the Napoleonic era on Tsarist society through the stories of five Russian
   aristocratic families with several chapters solely dedicated to
   philosophical prose, is only 3.2 megabytes large.
    
   For that reason, I don't recommend using `cat` to print the file. You can
   try it, but you'll be sitting there for a while. There's some text you need
   to find in there! Go find it without actually opening up the file itself! 
   (Hint: It's a url)

   Two lines above the URL is a secret solution. What is that solution?
   Hint for this one: "Context Line Control"

6. There's a file called `trojan_horse.txt`. Try reading it using less. 
   Surprise! It's not a text file.  Find out what file it is and what it depicts.

7. Finally, there's an empty file called `hello_world` in the directory. Write
   your name in it!

8. Once you're done **remember to fill out the [Google
   form](https://goo.gl/forms/H7odCjvpDYslkvSb2)**. There's some other questions
   you'll have to answer and some feedback we'd like you to fill out!
