title: Lab 1 - Unix, the Shell, OSS

Welcome to the first lab! Here are some commands you might find helpful:
`cat, cd, emacs, file, grep, less, ls, man, nano, tar, wget, vim`

Remember: Google and `man` are your friends!

## Shell spelunking
**Everything should be done via the shell!**

The purpose of this lab is to get you comfortable with using the shell for things you might typically use a GUI for. While these tasks may seem simplistic or limited, you'll quickly find that the commands have many different options (flags) to perform tasks that are either impossible or incredibly tedious / difficult to complete using traditional methods.

0. `ssh` into `tsunami.ocf.berkeley.edu` using your OCF account, or login at [ssh.ocf.berkeley.edu](https://ssh.ocf.berkeley.edu)
1.  Download the file located at `https://decal.ocf.berkeley.edu/static/b1/b01.tgz` and decompress it.

   A `.tgz` file is actually a composition of two commands. Sometimes you'll see these files as `.tar.gz` instead. A common (and old) way of archiving is with magnetic tapes. However, in order to archive the data, it needs to be a single file. This is where `tar` (tape archive) comes in. It'll group files into a single one. 

   `tar`, unless you ask it to, doesn't compress files itself though. This is where either `gzip` (or `bzip2`) comes in. `gzip` will compress your file, and so, tar + gzip is often used in conjunction. It looks something like this: `file --(tar)--> file.tar --(gzip)--> fill.tar.gz`.

   If you read the `tar` documentation carefully enough, you'll see that you can give the command an option to compress your files using `gzip` as well, saving you a total of one line of shell command!

   `tar` has a reputation for being a bit tricky with its options

2. Go into the `b01` directory. Make sure you're in there by running `cwd` (Current working directory). What does `cwd` give you?

3. There's a hidden file in the `b01` directory. What the secret?

4. A malicious user made its way into my computer and added a bunch of nonsense files. What do the files say and help me get rid of them. 

5. There's a file in `b01` called `big_data.txt`. It's 80 megabytes worth of text.  For reference, Leo Tolstoy's "War and Peace", the novel with a whopping 57,287 words depicting the French invasion of Russia and the impact of the Napoleonic era on Tsarist society through the stories of five Russian aristocratic families with several chapters solely dedicated to philosophical prose, is only 3.2 megabytes large. 
    
   For that reason, I don't recommend using `cat` to print the file. You can try it, but you'll be sitting there for a while. There's some text you need to find in there! Go find it! (Hint: It's a url)

6. There's a file called `trojan_horse.txt`. Try reading it. Surprise! It's not a text file.  Find out what file it is and what it depicts.

7. Finally, there's an empty file called `hello_world` in the directory. Write your name in it!

8. Once you're done remember to fill out the [Google form](https://goo.gl/forms/H7odCjvpDYslkvSb2). There's some other questions you'll have to answer and some feedback we'd like you to fill out!
