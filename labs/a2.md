Due: Monday 2018-10-08

### Grading note
Labs are graded on completion. Treat this lab as seeds of exploration instead
of just a grade. If you don't pass on the first submission, you can have it
checked off in-person by a decal facilitator. As this is the first lab, it
is intentionally simple and easy to complete, but should introduce you to some
fun bash features you may not have encountered before, such as loops and shell
expansions.

### Workflow
This lab can be done on your own UNIX-like machine, or you can ssh into
`tsunami.ocf.berkeley.edu` using your OCF account to finish the lab there. As
always, `man` and Google will be your friends.

## Debian: An introduction to `apt` and `dpkg`
In this class, we will be focused on using Debian. As noted within this week's lecture, Debian uses `apt`/`dpkg` as its package manager. Other distributions use different package managers.

### `apt`

The frontend package manager for Debian is `apt`. For the majority of times when you need to deal with a package manager, `apt` is usually the way to go. Before doing anything with `apt`, it is typically a good habit to update the package list so that the package manager can find and fetch the most updated versions of various packages. To do that, you can run:

`apt update`

To find a package to install:

`apt search [package|description]`

To install a package:

`apt install [package]`

To remove a package:

`apt remove [package]`

Once you have been using the packages that you installed for a while, you may notice that they don't automatically update themselves, a feature that may be present on programs written for other operating systems. To update the packages that you have installed, run:

`apt upgrade` or sometimes `apt dist-upgrade`

It is more commonplace to use `apt upgrade` to update your packages, but there are times when you need to use `apt dist-upgrade`. You can read up more about the differences between the two [here](https://askubuntu.com/questions/194651/why-use-apt-get-upgrade-instead-of-apt-get-dist-upgrade).

In some circumstances, you want to be absolutely sure of the version of the package that you want to install. To list the potential versions that you can install, you can run:

`apt policy [package]`

This lists the candidate version to install, according to its pin priority, along with other versions that are compatible with the system. To install a a version for a specific target release, you can run:

`apt -t [targetrelease] install [package]`

There are also other commands that can remove unneeded dependencies and purge packages, but that is what the `man` pages are for. Please note that you are going to have to use `sudo` for the above commands since you are actually modifying the system itself.

### `dpkg`
The backend package manager is `dpkg`. Traditionally, `dpkg` is used to install local packages. Using `dpkg`, you also can inspect packages and fix broken installs. To install local packages, run:

`dpkg -i [packagefilename.deb]`

To remove a system package:

`dpkg --remove [package]`

To inspect a package for more information about the package:

`dpkg -I [packagefilename.deb]`

To fix/configure all unpacked but unfinished installs:

`dpkg --configure -all`, which is often shortened to `dpkg --configure -a`

## Getting Started
We are going to use `gcc` to compile source code and a simple utility called `fpm` to create packages in this lab. Using the commands above, install `gcc`, `ruby-dev`, and `ruby-ffi`.

Now check if GCC is installed by typing the followng:

`gcc --version`

Now install `fpm` using `gem`, Ruby’s own package manager:

`sudo gem install fpm`

Now check if `fpm` is installed:

`fpm`

An alternate set of installation instructions for `fpm` can be found [here](https://fpm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing.html).

Now clone the `decal-labs` repository:

`git clone https://github.com/0xcf/decal-labs.git`

## Exercise 1: Compiling and Packaging
Packaging manually for Debian can be very hard and frustrating, especially for first timers. That’s why for this class, we’ll be using a really cool Ruby package called fpm which simplifies the task of packaging a lot. Please note that if you were going to package for Debian’s own repositories, this is ***not*** the correct/formal way to go about packaging. It is merely a great way to backport or package your own applications extremely quickly.

Now we will create a simplistic package using the hellopenguin executable that you will make in the coming steps. First, move into the a2 folder in the repository that you cloned in the Getting Started section:

`cd decal-labs/a2`

Now we are going to create a folder to work in for this exercise:

`mkdir ex1`

And now move into the folder:

`cd ex1`

### Writing and Compiling the Program

Now, we will make a very simple application in C that prints “Hello Penguin!” named hellopenguin. Invoke:

`touch hellopenguin.c`

This will create an empty file named `hellopenguin.c`. Now, using the a preferred text editor of your choice, such as `vim`, `emacs`, or `nano`, insert the following code into `hellopenguin.c`

~~~~
#include <stdio.h>

int main()

{

   printf("Hello Penguin!\n");

   return 0;

}
~~~~


We will now compile the source file that you have just written:

`gcc hellopenguin.c -o hellopenguin`

What this does is to take in a source file `hellopenguin.c` and compile it to an executable named `hellopenguin` with the `-o` output flag.

### Packaging the executable

Now, we will create the folder structure of where the executable shall reside in. In Debian, user-level packages usually reside in the folder `/usr/bin/`:

`mkdir -p packpenguin/usr/bin`

Now move your compiled `hellopenguin` exectuable into the `packpenguin/usr/bin/` folder.

`mv hellopenguin packpenguin/usr/bin/`

Now we will create a package called `hellopenguin`. Move into the parent directory of the `hellopenguin` folder and invoke the following:

`fpm -s dir -t deb -n hellopenguin -v 1.0~ocfdecal1 -C packpenguin`

This specifies that you want to take in a directory, using the `-s` flag, and to output a `.deb` package using the `-t` flag. It takes in a directory called `packpenguin`, using the `-C` flag, and output a `.deb` file named `hellopenguin`, using the `-n`, with a version number of `1.0~ocf1`, using the `-v` flag.

Now test it by invoking apt and installing it:

`sudo dpkg -i ./hellopenguin_1.0~ocf1_amd64.deb`

Now you should be able to run `hellopenguin` by doing the following:

`hellopenguin`

### Exercise 2: Troubleshooting
Now we are going to try and troubleshoot a package. Move to the other folder, `ex2`.

Try installing the `ocfspy` package using `dpkg`. It should error. Take note what it is erroring on! Now try and fix it.

Hint: Inspect the package for more details. The file to create that application is in the folder. Try compiling and packaging it. Exercise 1 may be a useful reference if you are stuck.

### Conclusion
After you’re done, complete [this](https://goo.gl/forms/WMhdZXAcTDPG7gOW2) submission form.
Note that you may want to clean up your VM by removing `hellopenguin`, `ocfdocs`, and `ocfspy` from your system.
