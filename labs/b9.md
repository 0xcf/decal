## Git IRL

### Fixing mistakes
If you ever feel like you need to start over, you can run these commands:
```
git checkout master
git reset --hard b9_start
```
And if you created the branch `my_branch`, delete it with
```
git branch -D my_branch
```

### Pulling the code
To clone the decal-lab git repository, run:
``git clone https://github.com/0xcf/decal-labs.git``

If you have already cloned the repository, go to your `decal-labs` directory
and run `git pull` to pull the latest changes. The materials for this part of
the lab will be in the `b9` directory.

Also if you dont have `make` installed, run the following command:
``sudo apt install make``

### Making changes
When making modifications to a repository, the best practice is to create a new
branch for your changes. To do this, run `git checkout -b my_branch`. This
command will create a new branch and switch to it.

Now we will make a modification to some\_code.c and commit it. Change line 4 to
`char *x = "Correct output";` and save. Now run
```
make
./some_code
```
This should output `Correct output` on the console. Now stage your changes and
make a new commit with a message saying "Added Correct output"
(hint: [lecture slide 6](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NxdvuLkWSzRvtnj41AkvGU00ub_XUbk8wlIxWxm0ok4/edit#slide=id.g707efdc427_0_0)).

Now we're going to add another feature to some\_code.c. Under the comment on
line 7, add the following code:
```
char* feature = "Heres my new feature!";
puts(feature);
```
Now again run
```
make
./some_code
```
And check that the output is "Correct output" followed by "Heres my new
feature!". Now stage and commit these changes with the message "Added my new
feature".

### Simulating change over time
Typically while you work on a branch, people will add modifications to the main
codebase, such as bugfixes. Lets simulate what this would look like.

First, checkout the master branch with `git checkout master`. Next, in
some\_code.c, change line 4 to `char *x = "Changed output";`.
Save this and run
```
make
./some_code
```
Which should output "Changed output". Now stage and commit these
changes with the message "Added changed output".

### Including your changes
Typically we create a new branch so we can add a logically associated set
of features to the codebase. Now that we've completed and tested this set
of features, we want to include our changes into the main repository.
Typically there are two methods of doing this, merging and rebasing. Many
people (including the OCF) prefer rebasing because its cleaner, so that's
what we'll do.

We will be rebasing our changes on top of the master branch. First, switch back
to your testing branch with `git checkout my_branch`. Now run `git rebase
master` to begin the rebase. You'll notice that there seems to be a merge
conflict, we'll have to reolve this before we can complete the rebase.

Modify some\_code.c to fix the merge conflict. We want to keep the line that
says "Correct output". Once this is done, save and run
`git add some_code.c` to resolve the merge conflict. Refer to the reference
section below for an explanation on resolving merge conflicts.

Now that the merge conflict is fixed, we can continue the rebase by running
`git rebase --continue`. Now the rebase should be complete. Confirm by running
`git log`. This should print out something like
```

commit b9a2169e7d53d7a30ae933e09aeb8e8245117c0c
Author: William Porr <wporr@nvidia.com>

    Added b9 code
```

Now that our branch has a clean history, we can merge it with the master branch.
This is where you would normally submit a pull request on github or some other
shared git interface, but we're just going to merge the branch ourselves.
Switch to the master branch with `git checkout master` and run `git merge
my_branch` to merge your branch into master.

#### Merge conflicts
Whenever we attempt to join the history of different branches either
through merging or rebasing, we can run into merge conflicts. These need
to be resolved by manual intervention.

The conflicted zone in a file follows the following format:
```
<<<<<<< HEAD
Line in the base tree
=======
Same line in your file that you're joining with base
>>>>>>> my_branch
```

To fix the conflict, you must remove all lines in the conflicting zone except
the line you would like to keep.

### Cleaning up
Now that your change is rebased, you can delete your branch with `git
branch -D my_branch`
