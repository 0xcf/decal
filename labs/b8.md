For the purpose of this lab, we will be primarily using [GnuPG](https://gnupg.org) (also referred to as GPG), a free implementation of the [OpenPGP standard](https://openpgp.org/). As stated by GPG's website:
>GnuPG allows you to encrypt and sign your data and communications; it features a versatile key management system, along with access modules for all kinds of public key directories.

## Encryption and Decryption
Encryption takes in input and a key, returning garbled output. Decryption takes in a key and the garbled output from encryption, recovering and returning the original input only if the decryption key is valid.

### Symmetric Cryptography
In symmetric cryptography, the keys used for encryption and decryption are the same. 

To try it out: 
1. `gpg -c [FILE]` on any file to output a `[FILE].gpg` file which is the encrypted version of the inputted file. You'll need to enter a password when encrypting the file.
2. `gpg -d [FILE].gpg` on the encrypted version of original file, upon which you'll need to enter the original password.

In this GPG implementation, encryption and decryption of your file both require knowledge of a single password, which in this case serves as the symmetric key. 

### Asymmetric Cryptography
In asymmetric cryptography, two separate keys are respectively used for encryption and decryption. Typically, the two keys come in a public-private pair. The public key is made known publicly and used to encrypt data. Whereas, the private key is kept secret by the owner and used to decrypt data. Encryption of a file with a public key implies that only someone with the corresponding private key can the decrypt the resulting encrypted file.

#### GPG Keyring Abstraction
GPG uses a "keyring" as a centralized location to hold all of a user's keys. You'll need to add/import a key to your keyring if you wish to use it and keep it around. Similarly, if you wish to share a key with someone else, you can export your key (which makes a copy of your key) and have them import it to their keyring. 

To try it out:
1. `gpg --full-generate-key` to generate a GPG public-private key pair. It'll ask for a password.
2. `gpg -r [RECIPIENT] -e [FILE]` which'll encrypt `[FILE]` with `[RECIPIENT]`'s public key (for now, try encrypting a file with your own public key). 
3. `gpg -d [FILE].gpg` will search through your keyring and decrypt the file with the appropriate private key (if you possess the correct private key, of course). 
*You don't need to specify which key to decrypt a file with because GPG-encrypted files and keys contain metadata that allow GPG to pick the correct key from the keyring to decrypt the file with.*

### Signatures
The asymmetric scheme involving encryption with public key and decryption with private key can also be reversed to implement signatures, which allows for the authenticity of some data to be verified. In this reversed scheme, the private key is used to sign a file, producing a signature on that file. And the corresponding public key is used to verify the signature.

To try it out:
`gpg --sign [FILE]` to sign `[FILE]` with your private key. `gpg --verify [FILE].gpg` to verify that the file was signed by one of public keys on your keyring. 

## Hashing (Checksums)
Hash functions deterministically map arbitrary-length data to a fixed-length hash (in other words, a fixed number of bytes). As a result, the latter can serve as a summary of the former if the former exceeds the latter in terms of byte length. For instance, if we download a 1GB file and want to verify its integrity, instead of re-downloading the entire file again, we can simply compute a 20B hash of the file on our end and compare it to the 20B hash of source.

To try it out:
1. `sha1sum [FILE]` to get the SHA1 hash of `[FILE]`.
2. `md5sum [FILE]` to get the MD5 hash of `[FILE]`.

There are [many hash functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hash_functions), some of which are cryptographic hash functions and others not. Crytographic hash functions primarily differ from non-cryptographic hash functions in that they are difficult to forge. For instance, if someone has a hash on hand, it is difficult for them to create a pre-hash file that maps to the same hash. If you are interested in all of the properties of a cryptographic hash function, [read here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function). In particular, SHA1 and MD5 have been proven to no longer be cryptographically secure and are only used for checksums to ensure data integrity.


## File Security
The UNIX permission model has 3 components: permissions given to the file's (1) owning user, (2) owning group and (3) others/everyone else. Permissions themselves have 3 subcomponents: (1) read, (2) write and (3) execute, which are self-explanatory in respectively enforcing the ability to read, write or execute a file.

To try it out:
1. `ls -l` shows all the permissions of the current directory's files in the leftmost column.
2. `chown [NEWUSER]:[NEWGROUP] [FILE]` to change `[FILE]`'s  user and group ownerships respectively to `[NEWUSER]` and `[NEWGROUP]`.
3. `chmod [PERMISSIONS] [FILE]` to set `[FILE]` with specified `[PERMISSIONS]`.

## Lab Checkoff
For the lab activities: `git clone https://github.com/0xcf/decal-labs.git`. You'll be working in `b8/`.
Here is the [checkoff form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdMDLNgyiIlXPz-DMig56Z10OAj0DU6nQOt5Ase4Y8dxoLPtw/viewform).

### Encryption and Decryption
1. Decrypt `b8/file1.txt.gpg` with the password `ocfdecal` (*for real-life purposes, never store passwords in plaintext*). What are the decrypted contents of `b8/file1.txt.gpg`?
2. How does one import a key?
3. How does one export a key to a file? (Hint: use `--armor`)
4. How does one see all of the keys on his/her keyring?
5. Use this private key `b8/privkey` to decrypt `b8/file2.txt.gpg` (*for real-life purposes, please actually keep your private keys secret*). What are the decrypted contents of `b8/file2.txt.gpg`?

### Hashing (Checksums)
1. What is the MD5 hash of `b8/file3.txt`?
2. What is the SHA1 hash of the MD5 hash of `b8/file3.txt`? In other words, what is `SHA1(MD5(file3.txt))`?

### File Security
1. `b8/file4.txt`: What are the permissions of this file? Explain what they allow and disallow.
2. `b8/file5`: Make this file executable and execute it. What is its printout?
3. `b8/file6.txt`: Change this file to be under your ownership.
4. `b8/file7.txt`: Make this file readable only to you. 
5. `b8/file8.txt`: Change this file's permissions such that only root should be able to read this file and no one should be able to edit it.
6. `b8/file9.txt`: Choose any method to make this file readable to you and unreadable to the previous owner.
