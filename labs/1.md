## Create SSH key
Run the following command, and accept prompts in order to create an ssh keypair:

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
```

Note: it's good practice to protect your ssh-keys with strong passwords, to protect against attackers who might briefly use... or completely steal... your computer.

`ssh-keygen` will create files `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub` inside the `.ssh` directory. View the file with `cat` or `less` later when viewing them to copy into a browser.

```
~ $ ls .ssh/
id_rsa id_rsa.pub
```

You can rename these files, but keep the public-private distinction, and make sure the base name matches (some tools expect this). Running `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048` instead is OK too.

**Note:** 1024-bit RSA keys are considered too short nowadays. They are not *yet* broken, but have no margin for safety. DSA and it's cousin ECDSA are considered secure, but have some secondary security risks. I make it a policy not to use them, though I'll likely never be bitten by corner cases. New implementations of ssh include new algorithms.

## VPS hosting provider
**Enrolled students** will have a Virtual Private Server (VPS) hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) provided for them.
**Auditing users** may wish to acquire a VPS from Amazon, Google, or Digital Ocean. Free service credits for AWS and DigitalOcean may be claimed at [education.github.com/pack](https://education.github.com/pack) after creating/logging in to a GitHub account and associating it with a '.edu' email address.

However, a VPS may not be required for the first few weeks of class, as many of the labs can be completed on our login server, tsunami, reachable at `tsunami.ocf.berkeley.edu` with the ssh command-line utility, or in a browser via the web-shell interface we provide at [ssh.ocf.berkeley.edu](https://ssh.ocf.berkeley.edu/).

**Fun facts:** We configure DNS so that `tsunami` and `ssh` are both valid names for our public login server, by resolving to the same IP address. `dig [host]` to see more.

## Set up SSH key & login
* Set up ssh key / password
  * **All command-line** (e.g. from the OCF to VPS or your computer's shell to OCF or VPS, hereafter `[target]`).
    1. Copy your public key, `id_rsa.pub` from where you created it to the server you want to have accept the key for authentication.
      * `scp .ssh/id_rsa.pub [target]`:
        * read `man scp`, the command uses `[host]:[path]format`, e.g. `ssh.ocf.io:~/.ssh/mbp_id.pub`
    2. Login to the target machine
      * `ssh infamous@ssh.ocf.io`
    3. Add your public key to the authorized keys file
      * `cat id_rsa.pub >> .ssh/authorized_keys`
    4. Test it
      * `ssh infamous@ssh.ocf.io` should not ask for a password.
      * *Extra: try `ssh -v` to see debug information*
  * With web interface
    1. `cat > public_key`
    2. Copy/Paste key from local to remote terminal
    3. `^D` - Control - D - EOF/End-of-File character.
    4. Proceed from step 2 of **All command line**.
  * The `ssh-copy-id` utility performs the same setup.
    * Linux, Windows with Ubuntu users: it's available from your package manager. `apt install ssh-copy-id`
    * macOS users: [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) will also allow you to install it with 1 command, `brew install ssh-copy-id`
