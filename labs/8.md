# Security

In this note, we will briefly cover a variety of topics that are of interest to those studying computer security. 

There are many aspects to security, and the field spans a number of disciplines. We will cover the following:

* Security Building Blocks
  * Encryption - Symmetric and Public-Key Crypto
  * Certs, Signatures
  * Hashing
* File Security
* Network Security

## Introduction

The most important thing to remember when designing secure systems is understanding your threat model. No system is guaranteed to be secure or able to withstand all attacks, nor is this even possible in the face of extreme adversaries. However, you can (and should) take precautions against the threats you are likely to face. Balancing the need for authorized users to get access to the system while keeping unauthorized users out is very easy to get wrong. Fortunately, smart people have distilled the principles of security down to a few axioms, covered very well in the first [lecture note][cs161_1] of CS 161 (credit to Prof. David Wagner). Please read the note prior to continuing.

## Security Building Blocks

### Encryption

Hiding information from those who are not authorized to view it is a critical element of computer security. How can you make sure this property can be maintained in the event of having to transport this information in the open? By encrypting it. 

Encryption involves taking the information you want to hide, called the _plaintext_, and transforming it by means of a mathematical function into a format that is indecipherable without a key, called the _crypttext_. There are many different types of encryption algorithms, with different types of encryption keys, encryption speeds, security, and usefulness. The most important quality of encryption algorithms is the fact that they are one-way: it is easy to compute the crypttext from the plaintext (encrypt) but extremely difficult to compute the plaintext from the crypttext (decrypt) without the secret key.

There are two primary types of encryption: **symmetric key cryptography**, and asymmetric-key or **public-key cryptography**. The invention of public key cryptography was critical to many of the security features we take for granted today.

For the purpose of this lab, we will be using several tools for performing encryption operations, among them **GnuPG**, a free implementation of the [OpenPGP](https://openpgp.org/) standard, and [**OpenSSL**](https://openssl.com), a library for implementing TLS, or Transport Layer Security.

##### Symmetric Key Cryptography

Symmetric-key cryptography is named for the fact that a single key both encrypts and decrypts a particular plaintext to crypttext and vice-versa. The most widely used method of symmetric crypto is AES, or _Advanced Encryption Standard_, which is certified and trusted by the US Government to encrypt information critical to national security. An easy way to visualize the basics of symmetric key crypto is by the XOR function: `a XOR b` is true if and only if a and b are different. Suppose our plaintext is the bitstring  `100110100101`, and we want to apply a bitwise XOR with the bitstring `010010100010`, which is our key. The result of this operation is `110100000111`. If we XOR the resulting crypttext with the key again, we get the original plaintext: `100110100101`. The XOR function is trivially reversible, but military-grade symmetric key cryptography algorithms are much more difficult to reverse. The security of symmetric-key crypto, therefore, is dependent on keeping the encryption key secret.

What is symmetric key crypto useful for? Almost everything: encrypting data in transit (for example, in HTTPS), encrypting data at rest (for example, on your iPhone or Android device, which is "encrypted by default"), and many other applications. On the iPhone specifically, several layers of symmetric crypto are at play: the iPhone's internal storage is encrypted with a set of AES keys stored on a chip inside the phone, generated at the factory. These keys are in turn encrypted with your PIN. Your pin allows the phone to unlock the keys that allow it to decrypt the rest of the filesystem. This is also how the iPhone is able to quickly wipe your data in the event your phone is stolen: the phone simply deletes the keys that are stored on the internal chip. Now, even with your PIN, there are no keys to decrypt and the encrypted data in the phone's storage is, for all intents and purposes, irretrievable and indistinguishable from random data.

##### Public Key Cryptography

Unlike symmetric key cryptography, there are 2 keys in a public-key cryptosystem, the public key and the private key. As the name suggests, the public key is shared publicly, and this is the means by which other people encrypt data that's meant for you. You use your private key to decrypt this data. As long as no one has your private key, anyone can use your public key to encrypt data and be assured that only you can decrypt it. This is a powerful expansion on the symmetric-key paradigm, as beyond encryption, it also allows for signatures and non-repudiation: a way for someone to verify that the person they are talking to is in fact the person they intend to be talking to, and for someone to prove (without the ability to deny it) that they are who they say they are.

Nowadays, public-key cryptography is synonymous with the RSA algorithm, which was one of the first proven dual-key schemes. You will encounter the RSA algorithm in CS 70 and CS 161 if you plan to take those courses, or already have. In short, the security of RSA depends on the theoretical difficulty of factoring large numbers on conventional computers. This is expected to continue to be a difficult problem until quantum computers become practical.

Here's a brief overview of how RSA public key crypto works: the RSA algorithm, by means of some advanced mathematics involving prime numbers and modular arithmetic, returns 3 numbers: a public exponent (aka key), a private exponent, and a modulus. The two keys work such that data encrypted with one key can only be decrypted with the other key. In order to encrypt data, one performs modular exponentiation over the data using one of the exponents and the modulus. In order to decrypt data, one performs modular exponentation on the encrypted data with the partner key and modulus. In common use, one uses the larger exponent as the private key, which is used for decrypting data and creating signatures, and the smaller exponent as the public key, which is used for encryping data and verifying signatures.

In lab 1, one task was to generate an SSH key, using the command

    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
    
This command would generate two files, `~/.ssh/id_rsa` and `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`. As the command suggests, this command generates a 4096-bit RSA key pair. You should be able to guess which file represents the public key and which one must therefore be the private key. In order to affect secure SSH logins using the RSA key, the user must first transfer the public key they wish to use to identify themselves to the server in advance. Then, once a session has been established between the server and the client, the server will encrypt a random number with the user's public key and transmit it to the user. The user will then decrypt the value using their private key and return a hash of that value to the server, who can then hash the value themselves to determine if the user was able to successfully decrypt the random number, thus indicating posession of the matching secret key and serving as proof for authentication.

###### Signatures and Certificates

Public Key cryptography allows for a number of important security objects, including signatures and certificates for digital identity verification. Suppose you are an important public entity (maybe your pseudonym is Natoshi Sakamoto). You are in charge of an important project, hereafter known at Tibcoin. You'd like to maintain anonymity, but still need to lead your project. How can your loyal followers know that statements supposedly made by Natoshi Sakamoto are actually from you? There's a significant incentive to make false statements supposedly "from" Mr. Sakamoto, because each Tibcoin is now worth a significant amount of money, and some people stand to gain substantially if they are able to influence the direction of the project to be in their favor. You can avoid this by signing your messages: in the beginning, you would publish Natoshi's public key, and thereafter, for every post you make, you would encrypt the content of the message using your (Natoshi's) private key and post that along with your original message. Then, anyone who wants to verify that Natoshi (i.e. the owner of the private key corresponding to the public key that belongs to Natoshi) did in fact publish a particular message can simply use Natoshi's public key to decrypt the encrypted signature and compare the content against the original message. Pretenders to Natoshi's throne will be unable to sign their false statements such that they can be verified with Natoshi's published public key because they don't have Natoshi's private key, and you can rest assured that no one will unduly influence your project while you go into hiding.

However, in this scheme, how do you prevent an adversary from publishing a fake public key and claiming to be you (they can make valid signatures against that fake public key)? Somehow, you need to "bootstrap" trust: someone would need to verify your identity and publicly affirm that your public key actually corresponds to you. We do this by means of certificates: a signed statement claiming that a particular public key does, in fact, belong to who it claims to belong to. Who signs this certificate? A certificate authority, someone we trust to be responsible about verifying identities and issuing signatures. But how do we know which CAs to trust, and how can we trust that a CA that claims to be trustworthy actually is? They probably need a certificate as well. It sounds like it might be turtles all the way down; however, the chain does end somewhere: the so-called root of trust, the root CAs. These are the CAs whose certificates are pre-installed by browsers and operating systems and therefore intrinsically trusted, without any further certificates necessary. If a root CA signs your certificate, we assume they've done the due diligence necessary to be willing to risk their reputation by signing your certificate, and basically take their word for it. This model, known as the "Web of Trust" is how network security works today. Unfortunately, it isn't as reliable as we may have hoped: some CAs are scummy and will sign anything for enough money, resulting in valid certificates being issued for domains like microsoft.com and github.com to entities who are very obviously not Microsoft or GitHub.[^badwosign]

You might not realize it, but you use and rely on certificates and signatures every day. Any time you see a green lock near the address bar of a website you visit, you are accesssing the site over a TLS or HTTPS connection, and the data being transferred between you and the website is encrypted. When your browser connects to the website's server, it asks for the server's public key in order to set up an encrypted connection, and the server's certificate in order to verify its identity as the server authorized to serve the domain you have requested. Your browser then validates the public key by verifiying the signatures on the certificate. If someone is attempting to perform a man-in-the-middle attack on you, this certificate verification step will fail, because it should be unlikely that a trusted CA will have issued a signed cert for your domain to an entity other than you. You will get a very intrusive notification informing you of this fact, and it is a bad idea to ignore the certificate verification failure notification.

##### Hashing

There are many times where we have large amounts of data but need to operate on smaller representations of that data. For example, suppose you download a 1GB file from the internet. You want to make sure that the file you downloaded has not been modified on its way to you (after having taken the DeCal, you know that integrity is a critical goal of computer security). How could you figure out if the file has been changed? You could try downloading another copy to see if there's a difference, but both copies could have been modified, and it takes a long time to download 1GB. You could use your knowledge of signatures to see if the source has provided a signature of the file you could verify, but the signature would have to be over the whole file[^pkcsize] and this is even more expensive. What we really need is a deterministic way to generate fixed-length representations of arbitrary-length data. Luckily, mathematics has our back with functions known as hash functions. If you took CS 61B, you probably implemented a hash table at some point, and may be familiar with the concept. Here's an example of hash functions at work. Enter the following commands on your student VM (i.e. `ssh username.decal.xcf.sh`) to calculate the SHA1[^sha1] hash of a 100MB file.

1. `wget staff.decal.xcf.sh/lab8/lab8.img`
2. `sha1sum lab8.img`

You should see `2712511cb3ca382641d9e74a7e8a5a38d3c4cac4`, a 40-digit string. As you can imagine, transferring this string is much easier than transferring a large, 100MB file, and because of the properties of the SHA-1 algorithm, you can be reasonably sure that this file, and only this file, will always hash to that particular value. This means, if you want to verify that the file you downloaded hasn't been corrupted, you can simply compare the hashes (or more specifically, a signature over the hash) to ensure that the file you've downloaded hasn't been tampered with. 

### Encryption Lab Activity

In this lab, we will be exploring the topics covered so far: symmetric encryption and public key cryptography, hashing, signatures, and certificates. Please make sure you are logged into the appropriate server over ssh prior to completing any of the following tasks.

##### Introduction: Making SSH keys

We'll begin our exploration of security building blocks by creating SSH keypairs for ourselves, in case you haven't already. If you already have an SSH key on your personal computer that you would like to continue to use, or one on `tsunami`, feel free to skip these steps and proceed to task 1, but please make sure that you can use that key to log into your student VM.

As mentioned earlier in this document, and in [lab 1](https://ocf.io/decal/labs/1), here is how to create a 4096-bit RSA SSH keypair.

1. Log into `tsunami`. It is important you do these steps on `tsunami` and not your laptop, an OCF desktop, or your student VM.
2. Check to make sure you do not have an existing SSH key:
    a. Enter `ls -l ~/.ssh`
    b. If you see files like `id_rsa` or `id_rsa.pub` then you already have an SSH key.
3. If no key is present, create a new key now by typing `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096`, and hit enter when prompted.
4. If you are asked to type a password to protect the key, you may choose to enter one, but for the purpose of this lab, it is advisable to skip doing so.

You should now see two new files in the `~/.ssh/` directory. `id_rsa` is your SSH private key, and it should like the following:

    $ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa 
    -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
    <random characters>
    -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY------
    
Please try to not lose or leak this private key. The public key, `id_rsa.pub`, should be much shorter and look like the following:

    $ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    ssh-rsa <characters> <username>@<host>
    
It is safe to transfer your RSA public key out in the open, whereas you should be extremely careful when doing the same with your private key.

You've just created for yourself an RSA keypair suitable for SSH authentication.

For the remaining tasks in this lab, you will be tasked with figuring out the appropriate commands yourself, by Googling, reading man pages, etc. Hints will be given as footnotes as necessary. Please document the commands you use and be prepared to provide a rationale for why you believe those commands are correct.

###### Task 1

Figure out how to use the SSH key you've created to log into your student VM.[^ssh-copy-id]

Perform the remaining tasks on your student VM unless otherwise specified.

###### Task 2 - Symmetric Encryption

In order to explore encryption, we're going to be using the `gpg` command.
    
1. Download[^wget] the two files named "t2q1.gpg" and "t2q2.gpg" from staff.decal.xcf.sh/lab8/, decrypt them using `gpg` and the passwords "decallab8" and "qwertyuiop" respectively, and answer the questions contained therein. What algorithms where the files encrypted with? 
2. Create a text file with your full name, username, and a random question in it. Then, use `gpg` to symmetrically encrypt this text file using the TWOFISH algorithm and a password of your choice. Make sure the resulting encrypted file is in ASCII-armored format[^armor]. Figure out how to distribute this encrypted file to someone else in the lab[^nginx], and have them demonstrate their ability to decrypt the file with your chosen passphrase. Get one such file from someone else yourself; you will be asked for it during checkoff.

###### Task 3 - Asymmetric Encryption

Remember to perform all the following steps on your student VM.

In this task, we will be using `gpg` to create a PGP key. 

Step 0: Figure out how to do make this key[^ghgpg], and create a 4096-bit RSA/RSA PGP key.

You might be wondering: didn't we just create a 4096-bit RSA key for use in SSH? Why can't we just use the same key for GPG? The short answer is that, while technically possible, it is [inadvisable](https://serverfault.com/questions/346958/how-do-i-import-a-rsa-ssh-key-into-gpg-as-the-primary-private-key) to do so for security reasons.

1. After creating the key, retrieve the key ID and keep it around for checkoff.
2. Export the public portion of the key in ASCII armor format and figure out how to distribute it. For every subsequent step, make sure to do everything using ASCII armored output where applicable.
3. The DeCal staff have a [public key available](http://staff.decal.xcf.sh/lab8/staff_public_key.gpg). Figure out how to import the key, and write down the key id.
4. Decrypt the files from Task 2 again: now that you have imported the Staff GPG key, has anything changed in the output?
5. Create a text file with a new random question, as before. Find someone in the lab, retrieve and import their public key, encrypt your text file using their public key and figure out how to get it to them. They should do the same for you. Decrypt their file and keep it around for checkoff.
6. Repeat step 5, but this time, sign the encrypted file, and verify the signature on the file your receive in turn, using the appropriate `gpg` options.
7. The DeCal staff have uploaded a [file](http://staff.decal.xcf.sh/lab8/ocf_address.asc) to help you figure out how to get to the OCF. However, we suspect nefarious elements may be trying to modify the file in an effort to divert students. Figure out if the file has been modified, and if so, fix the file so that the signature verification succeeds.
8. Where is your private key located? Write down the location where you expect the private key to be. 

We will return to encryption later in the lab.

###### Task 4 - Hashing

Fortunately all the common hashing algorithms have been implemented for us by various libraries. For this lab, please compute the requested hashes by any method you deem appropriate. It would be advisable to do these on an OCF desktop, or on your student VMs, but _not_ on tsunami.

1. What are the MD5, SHA-1 and SHA-256 hashes of this [large file](http://staff.decal.xcf.sh/lab8/lab8-big.img)? The file is big, it will take a couple seconds to download and run.
2. Download a copy of the CentOS 7 NetInstall ISO from the OCF mirrors (http://mirrors.ocf.berkeley.edu) and verify that its SHA256 hash is correct.
3. You may have noticed that the CentOS project provides a signature over the hashes it provides. Briefly explain why this is a good, efficient security measure, knowing what you do about how signatures, hashing, and malicious attempts at file corruption work.

###### Task 5: Certificates and Signatures

In this task, we're going to set up one of the most common uses of certificates and signatures: HTTPS. As you might have realized, you are now in possession of a website and webserver, (&lt;you&gt;.decal.xcf.sh), at least for the time being. Perform the following tasks on your student VM.

Suppose you want to start hosting files on your site for other people to visit and see. 
    
1. Customize the file at /var/www/html/index.html to reflect your individuality

You can see this new file at &lt;you&gt;.decal.xcf.sh in a web browser.
    
Brief background on how websites work:

* Your computer makes a DNS request for the domain name
* Your browser creates a TCP connection to the IP address returned from the DNS request, to port 80 on the remote server (in this case, your student VM)
* A web server like Apache or Nginx is listening on the remote server for connections coming into port 80, and it responds to requests accordingly.

In the case of HTTPS, the process works the same way, except the port changes from 80 to 443 and after the TCP connection comes a TLS connection, as described earlier in the certificates section.

Now that you have a website, you decide that, as a good internet citizen, you want to protect your visitors from the prying eyes of the government, by setting up HTTPS. You know already that you will need a public key and a certificate signed by a trusted root CA in order to do this. How do you go about getting one? Searching the internet, you find a wonderful project called [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) that provides free, signed certificates. Let's go about acquiring one. 

For the purpose of this lab, we will be performing all the required steps manually instead of using the automated tools for educational purposes.

1. The first step in acquiring a signed certificate is to generate the public and private key that the certificate will validate. We can do so by using the `openssl` command.

    `$ openssl genrsa 4096 > domain.key`
    
    As you probably guessed, we just created another 4096-bit RSA keypair, this time, in PEM format. Both the public and private keys are encoded in the file "domain.key," which you can see using `cat`.

2. For Let's Encrypt, we'll also need an another key for our LetsEncrypt account. Repeat the command from above, but this time, output to a file called "account.key".[^account.key] Let's also export the public portion of this key as you'll need it soon when you authenticate to LetsEncrypt.

    `$ openssl rsa -in account.key -pubout > account.pub`
    
3. Now that we have a keypair that we want signed, (`domain.key`), let's generate a "Certificate Signing Request" for it. This will be what you send to Let's Encrypt in order to get a certificate for your public key. It contains the metadata necessary for LE to issue a certificate.

    `$ openssl req -new -sha256 -key domain.key -subj "/C=US/ST=CA/L=UC Berkeley/O=Open Computing Facility/emailAddress=<you>@<you>.<you>/CN=<you>.decal.xcf.sh" -out csr.pem -outform pem`
    
    You'll find a file in your directory called `csr.pem` that starts with `BEGIN CERTIFICATE REQUEST`. What did you just do? You asked for a `-new` certificate signing `req`uest for the public `-key` in `domain.key`, using `-sha256` for hashing. You are &lt;you&gt;@something from the OCF at UC Berkeley, CA, US, and you're making this request for the domain name (aka `C`ommon `N`ame) &lt;you&gt;.decal.xcf.sh. You'd also like the CSR to be in `pem` format.
    
Now, we have all the data we need to actually get a certificate. Let's submit the request to Let's Encrypt.

4. Install the `certbot` utility and do the following:

Enter the following command at a terminal:

    sudo certbot certonly 
        --authenticator manual \
        --server https://acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org/directory \
        --text \
        --email <you>@<you> \
        --csr csr.pem

You will be asked to answer some questions, read them and type "Y" when prompted. On the last prompt, you will be asked to make a file available in the root directory of the web server, either by copying the file yourself or by executing the Python code provided by the `certbot` program. It is recommended to use the Python code in a new terminal window. Here is what the code should look like: (do not copy and paste this, use the code provided by `certbot`)

     $ mkdir -p /tmp/certbot/public_html/.well-known/acme-challenge
     $ cd /tmp/certbot/public_html
     $ printf "%s" <random> > .well-known/acme-challenge/<random>
       # run only once per server:
     $ sudo $(command -v python2 || command -v python2.7 || command -v python2.6) -c \
       "import BaseHTTPServer, SimpleHTTPServer; \
       s = BaseHTTPServer.HTTPServer(('', 80), SimpleHTTPServer.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler); \
       s.serve_forever()" 

After this, the `certbot` client will verify that the domain is legit and issue a certificate, writing it to your current directory, likely as "0000_chain.pem." 

This `.pem` file is your signed certificate! Once you set it up with a web server, people will be able to securely browse your website. 

Let's configure the webserver to use your new certificate to secure requests.

5. Install `nginx` if it isn't already present.

   nginx stores its configuration information in `/etc/nginx`, as you might remember from lab 6. If you navigate to `/etc/nginx/sites-available/`, you should see a configuration file named 'nginx-lab8.conf'. 

6. Edit `nginx-lab8.conf` using your preferred text editor and fix it according to the instructions contained therein.
7. Rename `nginx-lab8.conf` to `default` and reload nginx.[^reloadnginx]

Now, if you visit https://&lt;you&gt;.decal.xcf.sh, you should see the green lock in the address bar indicating that your website is secured with HTTPS!
    
For checkoff, please show that your have successfully requested and received a signed certificate and have configured nginx to serve files using the certificate and key to secure the HTTPS session. Please also explain what you did over the last several steps, to get the certificate.

### File Security

Now that you have some experience with the primitives of encryption, let's cover some practical topics in securing files on UNIX-based systems.

#### File Security and Permissions

The base layer in the UNIX security hierarchy is file permissions. Every file and process is owned by a user (and group), and by default, only the user/group that owns the file can edit it. You can see this by typing `ls -la` in your terminal:

```
admin@staff:~$ ls -la
total 104
drwxr-xr-x 9 admin admin  4096 Oct  3 13:01 .
drwxr-xr-x 5 root  root   4096 Oct  2 16:49 ..
drwxr-xr-x 2 admin admin  4096 Sep 21 21:11 .augeas
-rw------- 1 admin admin 27932 Oct  6 14:05 .bash_history
-rw-r--r-- 1 admin admin   220 May 15 12:45 .bash_logout
-rw-r--r-- 1 admin admin  3526 May 15 12:45 .bashrc
drwx------ 3 admin admin  4096 Sep 17 12:02 .config
drwxr-xr-x 4 admin admin  4096 Oct  3 12:47 .gem
drwxr-xr-x 2 admin admin  4096 Oct  3 12:46 .nano
-rw-r--r-- 1 admin admin   675 May 15 12:45 .profile
drwxr-xr-x 4 admin admin  4096 Sep 17 14:23 .puppet
drwx------ 2 admin admin  4096 Sep 17 12:09 .ssh
drwxr-xr-x 3 admin admin  4096 Oct  3 12:38 test
-rw------- 1 admin admin 21980 Oct  2 16:42 .viminfo

```

The first column, e.g. `-rw-------`, is the read/write/execute permissions for the file. The second and third columns are the user and group that own the file.

Let's break down the permissions seen in the example above. You'll notice that there are 10 entries: they either start with `d` for directory or `-` for regular files[^firstpermflag], the the remaining 9 entries are split into 3 groups of 3 permission each: `r`ead, `w`rite, and e`x`ecute for `u`user, `g`roup, and `o`ther. That means `-rw-------` refers to a regular file, where the owner can read and write but not execute the file, and where the owning group and
everyone else can neither read, write, nor execute the file. On the other hand, the permissions on the `test` entry (`drwxr-xr-x`) indicate that it is a directory, everyone can enter the directory (`d--x--x--x`), anyone can list files inside the directory (`dr--r--r--`), but only the owning user can write files inside the directory (`d-w-------`).

The kernel enforces file permissions, preventing running programs from reading or modifying files they aren't allowed to, and preventing users from executing programs that they don't have access or permission for. This is important for a variety of reasons. For example, certain UNIX user accounts have their passwords stored in a file called `/etc/passwd` or `/etc/shadow`. These files are owned by `root`, preventing regular users from reading or changing other user's passwords.

````
❯ ls -la /etc/shadow
-rw------- 1 root root 861 Oct  9 02:22 /etc/shadow
````

This highlights a common security issue in UNIX: programs running as the `root` user. When a program is started, it inherits its user and group IDs from its parent process, and keeps them unless it manually drops permissions. If you start a program as the root user, because, for example, it requires deeper system access, a vulnerability in the program means that an attacker can interact with your computer as the root user. This is a common problem in misconfigured webservers, where a server running as root with a directory traversal vulnerability might allow an attacker to read secret credentials stored on the server's filesystem.

The moral of this story is tied to the principle of least privilege: wherever possible, only give the minimum amount of permission or privilege possible. If a program doesn't need root credentials, don't run it as a privileged user. If a file has sensitive content, don't make it world-readable. 

How do you change permissions? There are two primary commands for doing so: `chmod` and `chown`. `chmod` changes the file mode, i.e. permissions, and an example of its syntax follows: 

````
$ ls -la ~/
drwxr-xr-x 3 admin admin  4096 Oct  3 12:38 test
$ chmod 644 test
$ ls -la
drw-r--r-- 3 admin admin  4096 Oct  3 12:38 test
$ chmod u+x test
drwxr--r-- 3 admin admin  4096 Oct  3 12:38 test
$ chmod 000 test
d--------- 3 admin admin  4096 Oct  3 12:38 test
$ chmod +r test
dr--r--r-- 3 admin admin  4096 Oct  3 12:38 test
```` 

`chmod` accepts file permissions in octal notation, which is the 
following:

| # | rwx |
| - | --- |
| 7 | rwx |

`chown` on the other hand changes the owner and group of a file. For example, suppose a file `instructions.txt` is created in your home directory (`~you`) by user `staff` with permissions `-rw-------`. You need to read this file to follow the instructions, but the `staff` user did not make the file world-readable so you could open it. In order to read it, you may first want to `chown` the file to yourself, by running `chown you:you instructions.txt`. This would change the file's owner and owning group, previously "staff" and "staff", to you. The basic syntax of `chown` is fairly simple:

    chown [-R (recurse)] [user]:[group] PATH
    
where `PATH` is the file or directory whose ownership you wish to modify.

Making sure that files are only accessible to those who should be allowed to do so, and that vulnerable programs are not given too many permissions, is a critical part of maintaining system security on Linux.

### File Security Lab Activity

Lets practice using the commands and concepts covered above.

`cd` into the folder `/opt/lab8` on your student VM. You should see a number of files named `file1.txt` through `file9.txt`. Please answer the following questions with regards to each of the files, and make note of what commands you use for checkoff.

1. `file1.txt`: make this file readable using `chmod` and answer the question contained therein.
2. `file2.txt`: if you read this file, you'll notice it contains important decal secrets. Use `chmod` and `chown` to make the file readable only to you. 
3. `file3.txt`: this is an even more important file. Only root should be able to read this file, and no one should be able to edit it.
4. `file4.txt` and `file5.txt`: these files are owned by another user. Choose any method to make the files readable to you and unreadable to the previous owner.
5. `file6.txt` and `file7.txt`: look at the permissions for these two files and explain what they allow and disallow.
6. `file8.txt` and `file9.txt`: provide a strategy to make these files readable only to you and the lab8user, and no one else. 

### Network Security 

On UNIX based operating systems, the network is the most common method of gaining unauthorized access to a machine. Why this is the case should be obvious: the network allows one to interact with a machine without needing any physical presence. Anyone on the same network as your machine can connect, and therefore attack, your machine. On the internet, this means the whole world can attack your machine. This introduces a number of security considerations when running networked applications.

The first step in securing machines connected to a network, or the open internet, is to make it as hard as possible for attackers to get to your machine. As you may recall from the networking lecture, processes interact with one another over a network by means of sockets and ports. Many protocols listen on well-known ports, such as SSH on port 22, HTTP on port 80, FTP on port 21, etc. We use firewalls and similar software to prevent unauthorized users from connecting to your machine. For example, the student VMs are heavily firewalled - the only traffic allowed from the internet at large is SSH (TCP to port 22), HTTP/S (TCP to port 80, 443, 8000, 8080) and a few other services necessary for labs (e.g. UDP to port 53 for lab 7).


The second step in maintaining network security is to audit which programs are running on your server, and to design your network to reduce the attack vectors on any single machine by separating concerns as much as reasonably possible. For example, it may not be a good idea to run a critical database server and a potentially insecure webserver on the same machine, as a vulnerability in one could easily lead to the compromising of the other. 

Finally, the hardest part of online security is auditing your own code. Ultimately, most security vulnerabilities arise from code you need to run to affect your business functions. For example, the popular CMS software WordPress, which is estimated to power nearly a quarter of all websites, has historically been extremely vulnerable to security bugs. Moreover, people like to install WordPress plugins, often written by amateur coders, which are even more insecure. Unfortunately, aside from being vigilant about monitoring your servers for intrusion and generally following good defensive programming practices, there isn't much one can do to avoid bugs in their own code. 


### Network Security Lab Activity

1. Make a list of all the services running on your student VM that are accessible from the public internet, what user they are running as, and what port they are listening on.
2. Use `less` and `grep` to open up and search your SSH login log file, located in `/var/log/auth.log`. Besides yourself, is anyone trying to log in? Who and why?
