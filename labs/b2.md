# Beginner Lab 2 - Core Shell

Welcome to Lab 2! In this lab you will be learning how to work productively in a shell.

Don’t forget to use Google and `man` when stuck. The resources linked at the bottom may be helpful as well.

## Setting up

This lab requires a `bash` shell, `vim`, and `tmux`.

## SSH (Secure Shell)

SSH allows you to log in to a remote computer through the internet. It is the equivalent of opening a shell on a remote computer.

The usage is `ssh [remote username]@[remote host]`.

### Question

1.  Log on to `tsunami.ocf.berkeley.edu` with your OCF username and password. There is a file in `~staff/public_html/decal`. Open it. What is the secret in the file?

## Managing Files, Pipes and Redirection


### Combining commands

Chaining together commands is essential to automating your way through the shell. Here’s a quick cheat sheet:

`>` : Redirect stdout to a file. (Will overwrite the file)

`>>` : Append stdout to a file.

`<` : Read input from a file.

`|` : Send output from one program to the input of the next.

### Questions

1.  What line could you use to save the first 10 lines of a file that do not contain any vowels to a new file called `return.txt`?
2.  How could you save the last 3 lines of `ls` into `output.txt`? (See `tail`)
3.  You have a set of old log files that you want to `move` to a directory of newer logs. What flag would you use to avoid overwriting the newer log file?

### Other useful tricks

`!!` can be used to repeat the previous command in the shell.

E.g.

`
    python program.py = python program.py
    sudo !!           = sudo python program.py
`

`!:[num]` is treated as the previous command’s [num] argument.

E.g.

`
    touch doc.txt = touch doc.txt
    vim doc.txt   = vim !:1
`

Note: This behavior is from bash and some other shells that implement it.

## A quick intro to `vim`

### Why `vim`?

*   It’s a descendant of vi, which was written in Berkeley.
*   Sometimes you will be suddenly thrown into `vim` via merging git conflicts or other programs.
*   It’s included in practically every UNIX environment.
*   You can be very productive when familiar with it.
*   It's fast and lightweight and runs on everything.

### Hello World
Vim is a modal text editor, meaning that you can change editing modes in order to do different things.
There are 3 primarily used modes: **Normal**, **Insert**, and **Visual** mode.

#### Normal mode:
  - Used for moving around and editing text
  - `hjkl` to move left, up, down, and right
  - `G` to move to end of file, `gg` to move to beginning
  - `i` to enter **i**nsert mode (`a`, `o` also change mode in different ways)
  - `dd` to cut a line
  - `yy` to copy a line
  - `p` to paste
  - `/` to search
  - `u` to undo
  - Type in commands with `:`
  - Save with `:w`
  - Exit with `:q`
  - Explore more commands online!


#### Insert mode:

![Example](https://d26aqo05ggejx9.cloudfront.net/i.gif)

*   Used for editing text like a usual editor
*   Arrow keys to move
*   Esc to exit to normal mode (lots of people bind it to Caps Lock)

#### Visual mode:

*   Enter with `v` from normal mode
*   Used to select text visually
*   Modify selection with normal mode movement commands
*   Use `o` to move the cursor to the other side of the selection
*   Yanking, deleting, and pasting use `y`, `d`, `p` (sound familiar?)

A key feature of `vim` is **chaining together commands**. Normal mode is essentially a massive amount of shortcuts that you can combine to quickly navigate and edit a file. Want to move down 3 lines? You know that `j` means move down 1 line, so you can use `3j` to move down 3. `d` is for deletion and `w` is to jump to the next word, so what does `dw` do?

### Questions

Try playing around with [lab2.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tanx16/decal-web/acbe5e9c8fb16bdfb26c39d4b29090240cba6d7d/labs/b2.md) while looking up some new commands. Use `wget` to download it!

*   How would you delete the previous 10 lines?
*   How would you put `vim` in the background?
*   How would you enter the shell without exiting `vim`, or putting it in the background?
*   How would you edit a new file alongside another file within `vim`?
*   How would you indent a block of text?
*   How could you add line numbers to `vim`?

## A quick intro to tmux

![Example](https://lightrains.com/assets/img/blog/tmux-tips.png)

### Why tmux?

*   You can open multiple windows when sshed into a machine.
*   You can go compile and run programs while editing them.
*   You can logout and ssh back in without having to reopen all your files.

### Getting Started:

*   Start a session with `tmux`.
*   Detach from a session with `Ctrl-b d` (press d after releasing `Ctrl-b`)
*   Split into 2 panes with `Ctrl-b %` (vertical) and `Ctrl-b "` (horizontal)
*   Swap current pane with `Ctrl-b o`
*   Create new window with `Ctrl-b c`
*   Go to next window with `Ctrl-b n`
*   Go to previous window with `Ctrl-b p`

### Question

*   Describe something you learned about tmux that was not covered in the lab or lecture, e.g. sessions, window management, or customization. Take a look at the resources linked at the bottom for inspiration.

### Advanced usage (optional)

*   Tmux can be used to share your session with others.
*   Try remapping shortcuts like the prefix `Ctrl-b` to something more convenient.
*   `Ctrl-b [` can be used to scroll around buffers and copy things.

Once you’re done remember to fill out the [check off form](https://goo.gl/vt5vo7). There are multiple valid answers for some of the questions. Please answer the feedback questions if there’s anything you want to say!

### Resources

One of the best parts about vim and tmux is their customizability. Look up some configuration files (aka dotfiles) online and see what you like!
