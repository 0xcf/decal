## Overview
At any given moment, there are anywhere from dozens to thousands of process running on a Unix system. The large majority of these processes, called daemons, run in the background. Daemons are crucial to having a usable system and provide much of a system's core functionality, including the graphics server, sound server, and networking services to name a few.

Today we'll explore these background processes and create some of our own! Make sure the following exercises are executed on your VM unless explicitly specified otherwise. Make sure to answer the questions on the google form as you work through the lab:

[Google Form Exercises](https://goo.gl/forms/cLLL8BaPze4ESq913)

## Which processes are running on my system?
Open up a terminal and run the `ps` command. You should see something like this:
```
  PID TTY          TIME CMD
 3634 pts/2    00:00:00 ps
15015 pts/2    00:00:00 bash
```

Now open up **another** terminal and run `sleep 1000` in the background, and then run `ps`. It should look like:
```
$ sleep 1000 &
[1] 29756
$ ps
  PID TTY          TIME CMD
29446 pts/2    00:00:00 bash
29756 pts/2    00:00:00 sleep
29757 pts/2    00:00:00 ps
```
In the **first** terminal run `ps` again. You should notice that the `sleep` process is not showing up, even though the thousand seconds haven't expired. (Exercise 1) Why do you think this behavior occurs (hint: TTY column)?

We can get the process to display on the first terminal by running `ps -u`, which displays all the processes running as your user. Notice the PID column; each process has a unique ID assigned to it by the kernel. One thing we can do with this PID is send signals to the process. `sleep 1000` is pretty useless, so go ahead and kill it -- `kill 29756` (substitute `29756`  with whatever PID `ps` outputted for you).

The most common use of `ps` is to run `ps -ef` to see all the processes running on the system. Run `ps -e` and `ps -f` independently to see how the flags work together.

## htop
Make sure `htop` is installed by running `sudo apt install htop`.

Now, open up a terminal and run the `htop` command. `htop` can be thought of as a more extensive version of `ps -ef`, whereby process stats are updated in real-time.

First press `<F2>`, scroll down to Display options, and check "Hide userland process threads." We won’t be dealing with those in this lab.

Now open up another terminal and SSH into your VM. Run the command `yes`. It uses a lot of resources as it prints a continuous stream of `y`'s. (Exercise 2) What resource specifically does the `yes` command exhaust? If you are having trouble finding this, press `<` to choose which resource to order processes by. Make sure to quit out of `yes` (^C) once you are finished.

### The process hierarchy
Run `htop` once more. This time click `<F5>` to enter Tree View. You should see a visual representation of the process hierarchy on your system, with everything stemming from `/sbin/init` (systemd).

For curious students that are interested in seeing a more extensive process hierarchy on a large system, you are encouraged to run `htop` on the OCF server `tsunami`. Let us know of any cool processes that you find!

### Orphan processes
Open a second terminal and SSH to your VM. Now run `sleep 1000 &`. You should see this new process pop into your `htop` session on your first terminal. If not, press `<F3>` and search for "sleep." (Exercise 3) What is its parent?

Select this parent and press `<F9>` to kill it. Send the `SIGTERM` signal. The sleep process now has `init` as its new parent, which is PID 1. What you just did is manually orphan a process; when that happens said process is subsequently re-parented by the `init` process.

Now go through the same steps again. This time, send the parent a `SIGHUP` (hangup) signal. Can you still find the sleep process? When `SIGHUP` is sent to a parent shell, the parent subsequently sends hangup signals to any child processes before terminating; all processes that receive `SIGHUP` from a parent shell will terminate -- this is one way to avoid creating orphan processes.

If you are interested in learning about the different signals, run `man 7 signal`. Note that you can run `man man` for an explanation about the different manual section numbers.

## Cron
So much infrastructure in the computing world relies on scheduled processes. This is the job of the cron daemon. For example, at the OCF, we use a cron job that runs every thirty minutes to keep our servers and desktops updated via `puppet`. To get a feel for the cron scheduler, we're going to write a basic cron job.

(Exercise 4) Open the cron editor by running `crontab -e` (if the editor of your choice isn't being launched, set the `EDITOR` environment variable), which will create a crontab for your user. Below is a sample task. Put this in your crontab:

```* * * * * date +"\%T" >> $HOME/timestamps.txt```

Right now this runs every minute. Modify it to run every five minutes and quit out of the editor. Make sure to leave this running while you complete the remainder of the lab as you will be turning this file in.

## Using systemd

### What services are running right now?
Run `systemctl`. You’ll see a long table of every unit known to systemd.

Let’s narrow it down to services for now. Run `systemctl --type=service`. Now you can see a list of all services running on your computer. Each of these services is a daemon running in the background. Do you see any familiar services running?

### Controlling Services
Now let's use `systemd` to control a an nginx web server. Install nginx by issuing `sudo apt install nginx`. Once that is done we can tell systemd to start the service with the following: `sudo systemctl start nginx`. Run `systemctl status nginx` to ensure it is running and navigate to http://*yourvm*.decal.xcf.sh/ -- you should be greeted by the nginx default landing page.

Now let's make nginx listen for connections on the nonstandard port 420. In `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default` change the following lines:

```nginx
listen 80 default_server;
listen [::]:80 default_server;
```

to:
```nginx
listen 420 default_server;
listen [::]:420 default_server;
```

Tell systemd that nginx has changed configuration and needs reloading with: `sudo systemctl reload nginx`. Now, accessing  http://*yourvm*.decal.xcf.sh/ should now give you a connection refused error and your webserver will only be accessible via http://*yourvm*.decal.xcf.sh:420/.

Note that not all services can be reloaded; systemd will notify you if this is the case and such services will have to be restarted instead with: `sudo systemctl restart yourservice`.

Finally go ahead and stop the nginx service with `sudo systemctl stop nginx`.

(Exercise 5) What is the difference between `systemctl reload yourservice` and `systemctl reload restart yourservice`?

### Creating a service
Let's set up a web server and create a systemd unit for it. Make sure `git` is installed; if it's not, install it using apt.

To get the code run:
``` git clone https://github.com/0xcf/decal-labs.git```

If you have already cloned the repository, go to your `decal-labs` directory and run `git pull`. The materials for this part of the lab will be in the `b6` directory.

We will also need to install some dependencies. Go ahead and execute the following commands:
```sudo apt update```
```sudo apt install build-essential make python-virtualenv```

Now run `./run`. This should start up a simple web server at http://yourvm.decal.xcf.sh:5000

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to write a systemd service that manages this web server. To do this, make a new unit file in `/etc/systemd/system/toy.service`. Refer to the slides for an example; DigitalOcean also has a [good guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-systemd-units-and-unit-files) on how to write systemd units. Here is a skeleton; all you need to do is fill in the values for each field.

```
[Unit]
Description=
Requires=
After=

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

[Service]
ExecStart=
User=
```

Some questions worth considering while writing this unit file are:
* What units needs to be started before a webserver starts (Hint: network)?
* What script should systemd run to start the webserver?
* Units run by root as default. Is that a safe practice for web servers?

You are encouraged to experiment with other fields as suits your liking.

Once you have finished creating `toy.service`, let's start the service and have the it start whenever our machine is booted.
```
# systemctl start toy.service
# systemctl enable toy.service
```

### Debugging
You can check if the unit file succeeded by running `systemctl status toy.service`. If you are having issues with the unit file or the web server, check the logs for this unit by running `journalctl -u toy.service`.  If you run into errors don't get demoralized (it is, after all, only a decal); as a sysadmin you'll have to become comfortable making sense of arcane error messages.

### Crash the service!
(Exercise 6) One of the great benefits of using systemd to manage your services is that you don't have to worry unnecessarily about bringing a process back up if it crashes. So let's crash the service! You can do this by either sending a POST request with the json payload `'{"crash":"true"}'` to http://yourvm.decal.xcf.sh:5000/crash (Hint: use `cURL`) or by killing the webserver manually by sending a signal -- both will cause the unit to crash. You can verify if you succeeded by running `systemctl status toy.service`, and the unit should either be in an `inactive` or `failed` state, depending on how you killed it.

Now add the following the `/etc/systemd/system/toy.service` under the `Service` directive:
```
Restart=always
RestartSec=10
```
To tell systemd that the unit file has changed run `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`. Now start your webserver and kill it again in any way you please, and you should see that it come back online after 10 seconds! Note that you can also run daemon-reload and change a unit file while a service is running.

(Exercise 7) Upload your fully featured `toy.service` file to the google form.

- Everything you wanted to know about Unix [threads, processes, process groups and sessions](https://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/lk/lk-10.html). Bear in mind that this document is a little dated when it comes to the code about threads, and its description of what happens when a pseudotty is closed is not actually correct.
