### Topics Covered

We covered a lot of material in the 
[lecture](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WXvw3ritRgR5fhKOug-VN_IG-SnXu2zC4vA70lvRmiw/edit).
Here's a short list of things you may be interested in looking into further, 
besides googling and reading the man pages for the commands we discussed in
lecture.

1. SELinux - Security Enhanced Linux, gives role-based/mandatory access control 
   facilities. Utilizing it is well beyind the scope of this class, but reading
   about how SELinux works should give you an appreciation for the degree to
   which people have thought about file-level security in the kernel.

# Lab Activity

In this lab you will implement some of the things we 
discussed during lecture.

### Generating and using SSH keys

Passwords can be guessed, and this is bad. Good security practice now involves
taking advantage of public-key crypto to authenticate SSH sessions. In this
section, we will be setting up SSH keys, if you haven't already.

Please log into `tsunami.ocf.berkeley.edu` first. These instructions will not 
work on a Windows machine.

1. First, make sure you don't already have an existing SSH key in use that you 
might overwrite:

        you@tsunami $ ls -la ~/.ssh
        -rw------- 1 <you> ocf <stuff> .ssh/id_rsa # if this already exists, continue to step 3

2. If you don't have an SSH key, make one with the following command
    
        you@tsunami $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
    
    You can give the key a passphrase if you'd like. This command creates a 
    4096-bit RSA private key (`~/.ssh/id_rsa`) and corresponding public key
    (`~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`). There are many types of keys in various sizes, such
    2048-bit RSA keys (`ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048`) or 384-bit ECDSA keys
    (`ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -t 384`) or more. The full list can be found in
    `man ssh-keygen`. Which one to use is up to your preference and/or
    [paranoia][^paranoia] about quasi-legal government surveillance.

3. Copy the public key over to your student VM

        you@tsunami $ ssh-copy-id you@you.decal.xcf.sh
    
    This command, as its name suggests, copies your public key (by default, 
    `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`) to the specified remote host, and appends the contents
    of the public key to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file, which is used to
    control which keys are authorized to be used to authenticate a user. To see
    specifically what happened, do `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`) on `tsunami`
    and then compare that to `cat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on your student VM.

At the end `ssh-copy-id` will prompt you to attempt to log into the server 
using your key. This should succeed. 

**Gradescope Questions** 
1. Paste the contents of `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` from your 
student VM. 
2. What are the permissions on your public key and private key? Why do you think they
are the way they are?

For an extra challenge (not part of your grade), configure `sshd` to only allow key-based login.

### Setting up a firewall

Although we've configured an 
[external](https://github.com/0xcf/decal-utils/blob/master/terraform/firewall.tf)
firewall to protect your VMs from external connections, you should still set up an 
internal, on-host firewall.

To do this, install `ufw`, the Uncomplicated Firewall. `ufw` is a easy-to-use
wrapper around the powerful `iptables` firewall. You should be able to figure out
how to set up `ufw` using the guides linked earlier and your own Google-foo. In
order to get checked off for this portion of the lab, ensure the following:

1. All incoming connections are blocked by default.
2. Allow incoming connections to your VM over port 22 (SSH), otherwise you'll be
   locked out of your VM!
3. Allow incoming connections for the ports necessary for the operation of the
   software you'll be installing later on in this lab. For example, if you are configuring a web server, you should enable port 80 and/or 443. (You can always come back to this after figuring out the next part of the lab!)
   for a web server.
4. Extra challenge (optional): Allow the above, but only for IPs originating from UC Berkeley's
   subnet. UC Berkeley has 3 primary `/16`s.
5. Double extra challenge (optional): Configure `fail2ban` to block IP addresses that are trying
   to brute-force your SSH password.

#### Gradescope Questions
1. What command did you use to enable a port?
2. Paste the output of `sudo ufw status verbose`. Make sure you can clearly see the changes you made in the steps above!
3. Why is setting up a firewall important? What are some security concerns that might arise from exposing a port?

## Choose your own adventure

At this stage, you should have a fully functioning Linux install! Now, your task is to install a useful service on your VM.

We've described a few examples below. Or, feel free to peruse the [awesome-selfhosted](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted) page for some inspiration!


### Music Server

Some music enthusiasts opt to own their own music files instead of using a cloud
service (Spotify, Google Play Music, etc). But, if the files are only stored on
your computer’s hard drive, how can you listen to your music when on someone else’s
computer or on the go? A music server like `CherryMusic` can solve this problem
while still giving you control over your files. Install
[CherryMusic](https://github.com/devsnd/cherrymusic) (or an
[alternative](https://github.com/Kickball/awesome-selfhosted#audio-streaming)) on your
DeCal VM, and load up a few tunes.

### Git server

GitHub is a good place to host your source code, but self-hosting your own Git
can be a good option if you need to store something private (and don’t trust GitHub),
hosting your own can be a good solution. While you can use Git to host a repo on any
SSH server using a [bare repo](http://www.saintsjd.com/2011/01/what-is-a-bare-git-repository/),
to get a fancy GUI you need to install special software. Some popular options
for this include [Gitea](https://gitea.io/en-us/) (which mimicks GitHub’s interface)
and [cgit](https://git.zx2c4.com/cgit/about/) (which takes a more minimalist approach).
Pick one and install it.

### File Hosting

Instead of uploading your files to Google Drive or Dropbox to be shared, you can
host on your own VM. A good option for this is [fluffy](https://github.com/chriskuehl/fluffy)
(created by an OCF alum!), which also doubles as a pastebin for quickly sharing code snippets.
For more options, look at the the [“simple click/drag-n-drop upload” section of
[awesome-selfhosted](https://github.com/Kickball/awesome-selfhosted#single-clickdrag-n-drop-upload).

### Password Manager

[BitWarden](https://blog.bitwarden.com/host-your-own-open-source-password-manager-ace147649936) is
a popular self-hosted password manager. You can use it to host your passwords if you
don’t want to rely on a proprietary third-party program (like LastPass). Alternatives include
[pass](https://passwordstore.org) which is a user-friendly wrapper around `gpg`. Please note that
your student VMs will be deleted at the end of the semester, so you should not use your student VM
for long term password storage.

#### Gradescope Questions
1. What did you install on your VM?
2. Attach a screenshot of your service in action. (This could be a web console or a command output in the shell.)
3. Briefly describe the installation process. Were there any unexpected roadblocks you encountered?
4. What are some security implications from hosting this service? How have you handled them (or are you not handling them?)
