### Enrollment
This is a **2 unit DeCal**. Since it is a DeCal, the course is P/NP. **You must
attend an infosession and complete Lab 0 to apply.** If you are selected for the
course, we will send you a course enrollment code by September 14.

### Lecture
Lectures are scheduled for **Tuesdays** for the Beginner section and
**Thursdays** for the Advanced section, from **8 to 9pm.** Due to the online
nature of this semester, we will hold lectures over Zoom or a comparable
streaming platform (to be announced). Additionally, lecture recordings will
be made available on this website.

<!-- Not applicable for fa20
OCF Lab, located at 171 MLK (MLK basement down the hall from the student store).
**Attendance is mandatory, with two allowed unexcused absences.** Some other
conflicts, such as exams, may be excused if you provide prior notice. Please only
come to the lab on the day corresponding to the section you are in.
 -->

While we normally mandate attendance, this will no longer be a requirement for
Fall 2020 given the remote nature of the course. Nonetheless, students will be
expected to view all lectures, as knowledge of their content will be assumed in
lab assignments.

**Lecture will double as office hours** for students to come in and ask
questions about lab work or covered material. The one-hour lecture slot will 
include some lecturing but will also include time to to work on the lab assignment
with the help of present facilitators. 

<!-- Not applicable for fa20
Note that we only have 30 computers in the lab,
but 40 people are enrolled in each course, so **please bring a laptop** if you
can. -->

### Labs
The primary assignment in this course will be **weekly lab work**.
Labs are designed to be be significantly hands-on. You will be working on
real systems, configuring, and fixing things, setting up services, and so on.

Each lecture corresponds with a lab, labeled by a "b" or "a" (for Beginner or
Advanced) and the week number. Except for b1 and a1, labs will general be
released about a week ahead of the corresponding lecture. You are *highly
encouraged* to look over the lab, and try to start it, *before* coming to
lecture each week. This will allow you to better utilize the help of the
facilitators, and will help you understand the lecture in a concrete way.

Each lab will be due **before the following lecture**. For example, lab a1 will
be due by **8pm on Thursday, 9/24** which is when Lecture a2 will be held. Please stay on
top of lab work! If extenuating circumstances prevent you from completing your
lab on time, please let us know as soon as possible and we will try to be
accommodating.

**You must complete all labs to receive credit for taking the course.** However,
we will allow **two unexcused late labs** to be turned in before the semester ends. 

## FAQ

### Will the DeCal be offered in the Spring 2021 semester?
There is a good chance it will! This will be updated to a more definitive yes or no by the end of October.

### How does enrollment work?
When we are open for enrollment, Lab 0 will be published on this site! We will send enrollment codes to those who complete Lab 0 by the deadline. Do note that we often have more applicants than space in the course, so getting an enrollment code is unfortunately not guaranteed.

### How do I know which track is best for me?
**Beginner Track** is intended for those who have little to no prior experience of
using Linux-based systems. We will be providing an overview to several important
concepts in systems administration, such as networking, shell scripting, version
control, and security. It's perfectly OK if you've never worked with or heard of
these concepts before- but if you're familiar with them, we recommend you opt
for the advanced track. Overall, we welcome everyone to this track!

**Advanced Track** is intended for those who have used Linux-based systems before
and are at least somewhat familiar with some of the concepts mentioned in the
beginner track description above. While there are no hard/enforced prerequisites,
we do recommend that you have experience with one or more of the following:
 - Using Linux as a primary/secondary OS
 - Using a package manager such as `apt` or `pacman`
 - Writing scripts to automate basic tasks
 - Basic networking (such as working with IP addresses)

If you are still unsure about which track to choose,
you can email us at [decal@ocf.berkeley.edu][email].

### I don't want units / wasn't accepted / am not a student. Can I audit this course?
We are working hard to get all of our materials online this semester for everyone to
access! Since we are no longer bound by physical constraints, feel free to attend
any of our scheduled lectures or complete any of the labs on your own. (You will
need your own Linux VM though- you can 
[install one locally](https://blog.storagecraft.com/the-dead-simple-guide-to-installing-a-linux-virtual-machine-on-windows/)
or get one from a provider such as [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/).)

### I'm stuck on a lab/concept! Where can I find help?
The best way to get support with course content is to either join our Slack channel at [#decal-general][slack], our Discord channel at [#decal-general][discord], or
ask us during scheduled lecture times.
