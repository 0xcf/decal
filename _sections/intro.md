# Welcome to the Linux System Administration DeCal!

> **Outdated Notice for Fall 2020:** The DeCal website is currently in the process of being updated for the Fall 2020 semester. The current content (slides, labs, and dates) on this website is reflective of the Fall 2019 curriculum. Stay tuned for updates to the website or [view the archives](/archives.html) for content from previous semesters!

This course will cover the basics of setting up and administering a
production-quality Linux server environment. By the end of this
course, we expect you to:

* be comfortable using GNU/Linux
* understand how different parts of the OS work together, e.g. init,
  processes, daemons, filesystems, etc.
* understand basic networking on Linux
* have a good sense about maintaining system security
* understand system administration essentials
* get a practical taste of what sysadmins do in industry.

The course will be taught in two sections: a "Beginner" section for
students with minimal background in GNU/Linux or system
administration, and an "Advanced" section for students with more
experience.

While we expect many students will have a CS background, **the only
real prerequisite is a desire to learn** about new and unfamiliar
technologies, which is a critical skill for sysadmins. The Beginner
section has been designed to introduce new users to Linux, and the
Advanced section has been designed to give more experienced users a
taste of what Linux is capable of.
