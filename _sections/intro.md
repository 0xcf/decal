<p class="alert alert-warning">

  We will be having <b>two</b> infosessions, on <b>Tuesday, Sept 3</b>
  and <b>Thursday, Sept 5</b>, from <b>8 to 9pm</b> in the OCF lab at
  <b>171 MLK</b>. Both infosessions will cover the exact same
  information. Attending an infosession is required if you want to
  take the DeCal.

This course will cover the basics of setting up and administering a
production-quality Linux server environment. By the end of this
course, we expect you to:

* be comfortable using GNU/Linux
* understand how different parts of the OS work together, e.g. init,
  processes, daemons, filesystems, etc.
* understand basic networking on Linux
* have a good sense about maintaining system security
* understand system administration essentials
* get a practical taste of what sysadmins do in industry.

The course will be taught in two sections: a "Beginner" section for
students with minimal background in GNU/Linux or system
administration, and an "Advanced" section for students with more
experience.

While we expect many students will have a CS background, **the only
real prerequisite is a desire to learn** about new and unfamiliar
technologies, which is a critical skill for sysadmins. The Beginner
section has been designed to introduce new users to Linux, and the
Advanced section has been designed to give more experienced users a
taste of what Linux is capable of.
