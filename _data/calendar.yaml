# There should be an entry here for each day of class.
# Lecture and Lab IDs should correspond to IDs in materials.yaml.
# The lecturenote key can be used to display a message about the lecture
# (which will probably be a cancellation).
# Whichever day is marked as primary will be the day that the sign-in link
# is active for.
