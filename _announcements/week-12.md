1. **Bonus [lab 11](/labs/11) has been released** and will be due on 5/9! Lab 11 is optional and may be used to replace an incomplete and/or late lab. Note that lab 0 does not count towards the required 10 labs.
1. **End-of-semester notices:** Unless you have requested a lab drop, please remember that **10 labs must be completed before the end-of-semester deadline of Sunday, 05/09**. The optional 11th lab will be released next week and will be due on 5/9, for those who were not able to complete a regularly scheduled lab.
